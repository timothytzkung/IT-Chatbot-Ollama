It's best to send separate messages to each segment with instructions tailored for that group: for example, send a message to the SFU Computing ID group that simply points them to https://sfu.simplyvoting.com to log in, where they will see their eligible elections displayed on the dashboard; for the other segment with only email addresses, send them an email with the custom voting link. There are many ways to handle this situation, including the approach of sending all voters a unique link instead of requiring SFU CAS login: we'd suggest using CAS whenever possible and for highly sensitive votes where the strongest possible auditing is needed.

In order to require people to log in via SFU CAS, you must upload your voters' list with the Elector ID field containing the SFU Computing ID. The SFU Computing ID is the identifier that you usually use to log in to campus system without @sfu.ca appended. For example, \"kipling\" is the SFU Computing ID, not \"kipling@sfu.ca\" or other email address variants like \"rudyard_kipling@sfu.ca\" When you use this method, you can use the default email template to send out messages that will include only the voting website URL: https://sfu.simplyvoting.com . When a person visits that address, they will be asked to log in with SFU CAS and be presented with a dashboard showing them the elections for which they are eligible to vote. The default \"Email Blast\" template includes the SFU site URL via the {{voting_website_link}} placeholder, so the default email template can be used. I don't have a list of SFU Computing IDs, but I do have email addresses, how do I add voters? When you upload your voters list from a CSV file, you can use email addresses for both the \"Elector ID\" and the \"Email\" fields. In this scenario, people will not use SFU CAS to login but will instead get a unique link sent to allow a single vote to be made from each email address. When you use this method, you will need to modify the default \"Email Blast Template\" to replace {{voting_website_link}} with {{direct_vote_link}}. {{direct_vote_link}} will be replaced in the email body with a unique, one-time voting link for the recipient of the email. .", "token_count": 295}

In order to use SFU CAS, your voters' list must be uploaded to Simply Voting using the electors' SFU Computing IDs. The SFU Computing ID is the 8-character-or-less ID that an individual typically types into systems to log in (eg. Rudyard Kipling may have an email address of rudyard_kipling@sfu.ca, but log in as \"kipling\" into SFU systems. The \"kipling\" variant is what is needed for the Simply Voting voters' list in order to enable log in using SFU CAS). If you have lists of voters in a tool such as SFU Maillist or SFU Groups, you can download the SFU Computing ID from those lists/groups, but you may need to remove the \"@sfu.ca\" suffix from each entry in order to get the format needed for Simply Voting -- eg. \"kipling@sfu.ca\" downloaded from one of those tools becomes \"kipling\") Note: Voter ID should be the SFU Computing ID (eg. \"kipling\"), not a staff/student ID number (eg. \"30005555\"). Computing IDs can be found in various administrative systems such as MyINFO for staff, or can be downloaded from SFU Maillist or SFU Groups if you have the target membership in an existing list or group. If you do *not* have a complete list of SFU Computing IDs for your electors/voters, you can alternatively use email addresses and have the system send out unique, one-time voting links to each email address on your voting list. Both methods restrict votes to one per voter appropriately. If", "token_count": 300}

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a proactive security solution that protects against malicious activity before it can create a problem to the end user. To recognize and respond to potential threats and to protect the SFU community’s information and data, Information Security Services and IT Services are creating a more secure digital space and will continue to execute projects like EDR from the latest security plan. Why is EDR being implemented? EDR, along with other information security initiatives such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and regularly resetting our passwords, are proactive ways we can enhance our ability to counter cyber-attacks and better protect the SFU community. IS EDR Monitoring my files or webpages I visit? No. EDR software monitors malicious application activity and doesn’t monitor individual use or their files. It is NOT monitoring and reporting individuals’ activities on the web nor processing or indexing their files or other information on their computers. The new EDR program monitors what applications are doing on your computer – not you. How does it Impact Managed Devices? Users don’t need to do anything and won’t notice any differences on their managed devices unless there’s a malicious attack on their computer. EDR software runs in the background of your managed device and if/when malicious activity is identified, you will receive a pop-up notice. Users with EDR installed may also notice a new green circle icon in the menu on your device. How edr can help mitigate effects of a ransomware attack? EDR works at the kernel level, to evaluate and prevent activity that the operating system simply shouldn’t be doing. As compared to anti-virus software which uses canned heuristics or file-based signatures to block activity.", "token_count": 287}

However, EDR would stop it because the process that kicks off the encryption isn't started by Windows security policy or other standard deployment methods.

If there are any suspicious requests for your personal information , look for any indicators to determine if it may be a phishing attempt. 1. The Sender The Sender : The contents of the email message should match who sent the email. Also, be sure that the email ends with \"@sfu.ca\". As an example, IT related messages should come from an SFU IT staff or role account that ends with \"@sfu.ca\". Ask yourself, does it make sense for this individual to send the contents in the email message and was this sent from an SFU email? In this example, a student account was sending this message on assistance programs which should raise some red flags. 2. Format or layout Format or Layout : Official SFU messages put in considerable effort not appear like phishing email. This includes introductions, additional context and support points, proper use of SFU logos, fonts, highlights and punctuation. Ask yourself, does this message contain sufficient information and proper use of formatting? In this example, there is insufficient context around why you are eligible, and odd usages of SFU logo and punctuations. 3. Honeypot or Threatening Language Honeypot or Threatening Language : Phishing emails tend to include language that incentives or threatens the user to take urgent action before a deadline, whether it may be a reward or consequence. Ask yourself, is this too good (or bad) to be true and if I'm being rushed? In this example, it attempts to bait users to provide their information for financial incentives. 4. Grammar Errors or Awkward Phrasing Grammar Errors or Awkward Phrasing : Similar to Point #2, official SFU messages put in considerable effort to ensure that there are no grammar errors or awkward phrasing.

Although mistakes may happen, a significant number of typos, grammar errors or awkward phrasing can indicate phishing attempts if there are call to actions. Ask yourself, are there typos, grammar errors or awkward phrasing in the email message? In this example, there are many incorrect usage of punctuations and awkward phrasing. 5. External Links or Suspicious Attachments External Links or Suspicious Attachments : Official SFU messages make a conscious effort to let readers know where links will take them and if there are any attachments. Any form links should point to an SFU service, such as SFU's Microsoft Form or SurveyMonkey. For attachments, in most cases, they should be office files, .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, .pptx. Be wary of any non-office files, unless you're expecting it to be. Ask yourself, does this link take me to website I've never seen before? Or, am I being asked to open an attachment I wasn't expecting? In this example, the phishing message is attempting to persuade users to go to an unknown webform and fill out their personal information. 6. Odd sign off and signature Odd Sign Off and Signature : The signature of the email message should match who (the account) is sending the email. Similar to Point #2, the sign off should be professionally written and formatted. Ask yourself, does the signature look strange and does it match with the sender? In this example, the sign off does not match the sender. Additionally, the signature does not look professional. How you can protect yourself?", "token_count": 298}

It's like having a meeting spot where everyone can gather and share ideas, files, and conversations all in one place without needing to become team members themselves. This ensures members of your team can collaborate with others without sharing all the content in your team. How to Create a Shared Channel Creating a shared channel is a simple process. Here’s how you can do it: Open Microsoft Teams and navigate to the team where you want to create the shared channel. Click on the three dots (...) next to the team's name. Select Add a channel. Name your channel and add a description if you like. Under \"Choose channel type\", select \"Shared - People you choose from your org and other orgs have access\". Finally, click Create. For more detailed instructions, view the Microsoft support article Create a shared channel in Microsoft Teams . External Collaboration Limits at SFU At SFU, shared channels are designed for internal collaboration, making it easier for departments and project teams to work together while keeping the team itself private to members.

What's the difference between a group expiring and archiving a team? What is a Microsoft 365 group? A Microsoft 365 group is what powers the membership of many Microsoft 365 apps and services. For example, when you request a team in MS Teams you're actually creating a Microsoft 365 group in the background. This core group helps you manage the membership, access and collaboration between other Microsoft 365 services so you can focus on a single consistent experience with your team; rather than managing access to multiple Microsoft services. For example, when you create a new team in MS Teams a Microsoft 365 group is created that: Sets the security and access rules for the initial team owner, who can then manage additional owners/members. Creates and coordinates the online storage space the group will use to store documents and content. Creates and coordinates the underlying communication space so the group can chat with each other. Maintains the membership to other Microsoft 365 apps the team may need (such as Planner...etc). When does a Microsoft 365 group expire? Unless you manually delete a team/Microsoft 365 group, it will automatically expire 2-years after the date of last activity. After a group is deleted (either due to inactivity or someone chooses to delete it) it will a go into 30-day grace period where it can be restored by IT Services upon request.

However, after the grace period ends the group will be permanently deleted and any documents or content associated with the group will be lost. How do I know if my Microsoft 365 group is about to expire? Anyone with an ownership role (e.g. Team Owner) in the group will be notified 30, 15, and 1 day before their group is about to expire. This notification will be sent to the SFU email address of group owners. Additionally, a reminder will be sent from the activity feed on MS Teams. You can also check the expiration date of your group in MS Teams. For more information see Team Expiration and Renewal . Security Tip: Expiration notices will be sent from an email address that ends in microsoft.com . Be cautious of impostor emails. How do I renew a Team (and Microsoft 365 group)? If you are an owner of a team (Microsoft 365 group), you can renew it by following the instructions in the notification email. Additionally, see Renew a team in Microsoft Teams for information on how to renew a team in the MS Teams app directly. What keeps a Team/Microsoft 365 group active?

Teams - Visit a teams channel or view, edit, download, move, share, or upload files related to the team. Forms - View, create, or edit forms, or submit a response to a form. Why does SFU expire Microsoft 365 groups? As part of SFU's Data Security Standards , expiring inactive Microsoft 365 groups helps our community responsibly work with and dispose of data that is no longer in use. In addition, expiring groups helps teams focus in active collaboration spaces rather than inheriting spaces that have been abandoned. What's the difference between a group expiring and archiving a team? Archiving a group will put it's content into a read-only state while group expiration will delete the group overall.

Think of a group as a team or a club: when you add users to a group, you can manage their access to resources and privileges all at once, instead of doing it individually for each user. Since SFU is a large and complex organization, managing groups instead of individual users ensures our resources are organized and secure. It also makes sure that only the right people can access certain resources. Type of Groups In SFU Groups, there are two types of groups", "token_count": 152}

Exchange Distribution Groups (EDGs, or distribution groups) is a feature of Microsoft Exchange (SFU's email system) that allows a user to send messages to a list of SFU email addresses, or to members of other SFU Groups, all at once. For more information, visit Request an Exchange Distribution Group . Security groups (or reference groups) are used for security or access control to services or resources. Security groups contain a list of SFU members and can be synced to multiple services or resources to provide access, assign privileges or provision licensing. For more information, visit Request a Security Group (Reference Group) . Some security groups may be called reference groups if they are managed by departments or staff. This is to distinguish from policy groups (also security groups) which are managed by IT service managers and IT admins.

Read more about: SFU's transition from maillists to Exchange Distribution Groups, SimpleLists, and Campaigner Grouper, SFU's new access control and group management system What do I need to do? Gather a list of affected labs and users. (see \"Can I get a list of labs/file shares...\" below) Create reference groups for each lab. Grouper best practices advise you to create small groups (e.g., ref:dept:cmns:labX_members and ref:dept:cmns:labX_admins ) and add those groups to a larger composite group (e.g., ref:dept:cmns:labX_all ). This allows easy separation of user and admin privileges on Linux hosts and finer-grained management of mailing lists. Sync your reference groups to Active Directory by creating new groups under resource:app:ADSFU:SFUGroups. Active Directory groups require unique names, so it would be wise to prefix these group names with your school or department name. (Repetition of unit names is discouraged elsewhere in Grouper.) Create e.g., resource:app:ADSFU:SFUGroups:cmns_labX_members. Add the group ref:dept:cmns:labX_members to resource:app:ADSFU:SFUGroups:cmns_labX_members . (Do not add individual users to the resource:... group; add the reference group itself.) Contact research-support@sfu.ca with the lab name and group information you used in Step 3. When do I need to do this? Active Directory groups based on maillists will be purged in the medium-term future since they can no longer be updated and thus pose a security risk.

NAC FAQs What is Network Access Control (NAC)? NAC is a security enhancement tool that ensures only authenticated users and authorized, compliant devices can access SFU’s network, protecting your data and work. NAC strengthens SFU’s defenses against cyber threats and aligns with the goals of What’s Next: the SFU Strategy and the SFU IT Plan . When will NAC be implemented? Surrey Campus: April 2025 Vancouver Campus: June 2025 Burnaby Campus: October 2025 Can I opt out? If you are on a managed PC or MAC, NAC will automatically roll out to your machine. This is an essential security service. Am I being tracked? Only your managed machine is verified on the SFU network; no data is being tracked – NAC does not view your files or web traffic. Will this affect my ability to connect to SFU’s network? You will experience no changes in accessing the SFU network at this time. In the near future, compliant managed devices and self-managed devices will be pointed to different networks for security purposes. What is a managed device? For VPFA staff, managed devices refers to desktops and laptops that are managed by IT Services. If you are part of faculty, you may want to consult with your local IT group as to whether your device is managed by your local IT group or by IT Services. Staff and faculty can enroll their devices purchased through SFU's Procurement Services into managed devices, to benefit from standards that ensure the device", "token_count": 300}

Managed devices can also be found in offices, lecture rooms, labs, and libraries on campuses. See Managed Computer Services for more details. How does nac impact sfu managed devices? You don’t need to take any action and won’t notice any changes on your managed device unless there’s a network compliance issue. NAC operates quietly in the background, ensuring secure access to SFU’s network. You may notice a new NAC icon in the menu bar or system tray of your device. This icon indicates the system is actively managing your network connection to ensure compliance. What if I don’t have an SFU managed device? Self-managed devices will move to a different network and may have future network limitations . Who should I contact if I have questions or encounter issues? Please contact the Network Services team at ns-help@sfu.ca if you have questions. To report an issue, you or your local IT admin can create a ticket in TDNext .", "token_count": 221}

Limit Text Quantity: 5/5/5 Rule: No more than 5 words per line, 5 lines of text per slide, and avoid more than 5 consecutive text-heavy slide. 2. Focus on a Single Idea per Slide: Concentrate on one main point per slide to prevent overwhelming the audience and to maintain a clear narrative 3. Maintain Consistent Design: Use uniform fonts, colors, and layouts throughout the presentation to create a cohesive and professional appearance 4. Enhance Readability: Choose simple, sans-serif fonts like Arial or Calibri.Ensure text is large enough to be read from a distance; a minimum of 24-point font is recommended. Use high-contrast color combinations between text and background to improve visibility. 5. Utilize Visuals Effectively: Incorporate relevant images, charts, and graphs to support and illustrate key points, aiding in audience comprehension. 6. Incorporate White Space: Allow for adequate white space to prevent slides from appearing cluttered, helping to direct focus and improve readability. 7. Get timing right: When adhering to the “one idea per slide” principle, the time spent on each slide can vary based on the complexity of the content and the overall length of your presentation. A general guideline is to spend approximately 1 to 2 minutes per slide. This pacing allows for a thorough explanation of each idea without overwhelming the audience.

As AI systems, particularly generative AI, become more powerful, they introduce new risks to data security, personal privacy and even broader cybersecurity. There is a lot to consider in this section, so we'll outline some of the key concerns and challenges. Data Privacy and Unintended Exposure AI systems often train on large data sets that include personal or proprietary information. A major concern is unintended data leakage – models might inadvertently expose sensitive information that was in the training data. For instance, if employees input confidential text into a generative AI service, that data might get used to further train the model and later emerge in another user’s output. Generative AI models can “remember” fragments of their training data , raising the risk that private information (like a person's contact info or proprietary code) could be regurgitated in responses. As a precaution, many organizations limit what data can be fed into public AI tools and AI providers are working on techniques to better filter or forget sensitive training data .", "token_count": 188}

Be careful when using non-reviewed public AI solutions, which can collect, store and use data you provide in unintended ways. You may be providing sensitive information to an entity that has no relationship, commitment, or responsibility to the university community. Intellectual Property and Copyright Generative AI raises questions about intellectual property (IP). Models trained on vast internet data might output content that unintentionally copycats copyrighted material . For example, a generative model might produce a passage of text almost identical to something in its training set (e.g., from a book or article), or an image model might generate something that resembles a specific artist’s work. This blurring of originality complicates who owns AI-generated content and whether using certain training data infringes copyrights. Organizations deploying generative AI must be careful to avoid legal issues from AI output. Responsible AI use entails respecting IP rights , perhaps by curating training data or allowing authors to opt out and by guiding users to use AI outputs ethically (not passing off AI-generated art as human-made if that violates terms, for instance).", "token_count": 205}

Staying ahead of these governance requirements is a part of responsible AI strategy for any institution. SFU Guidance AI systems must protect personal data and be built with strong safeguards against unauthorized access. Security ensures that information is handled responsibly throughout the system’s lifecycle and that robust security controls are in place to prevent abuse. Use only university-reviewed systems when entering personal information into AI tools, to ensure compliance with institutional privacy and security standards. Conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for new AI solutions, and update PIAs if they have significantly changed. Apply security safeguards proportional to data sensitivity . While evaluating AI solutions, choose privacy-protective technologies. Accountable Accountable means that organizations and people remain responsible for the outcomes of AI systems . If an AI system causes harm or makes a mistake, there should be a clear path to address it and a person or team responsible for it. The idea is that AI should not be an excuse to “pass the buck” – those who use AI must ensure it is used correctly and take responsibility for its impacts. SFU Guidance Organizations must remain answerable for how AI systems are developed and used. This includes ensuring decisions can be traced, data is used legally, and people—not machines—are ultimately responsible.

You remain accountable for content generated by AI solutions you use, including the impacts of its use elsewhere. Responses from AI generated content must not be treated as a source of authority. If you are an SFU employee, do not use AI to collect personal information from public sources (such as websites, social media...etc.) except where specifically authorized and only after informing the individuals whose data is being collected. Understand that when AI generates information about a specific person—even if it's guessed or inferred—it still counts as personal data and must be handled according to privacy laws. Ensure that any personal information entered into AI systems is handled in accordance with the original Collection Notice and relevant privacy obligations, including the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. or applicable university policies for your area. When considering AI solutions identify the impacts they could have on individuals or groups. Evaluate if it will be necessary for your purpose and not merely convenient. Fair AI systems should treat individuals and groups fairly , avoiding discrimination. This means the AI’s decisions or outputs should not be prejudiced against people on the basis of characteristics like race, gender, or other protected attributes. A known challenge is that AI models can inherit biases present in their training data. Mitigating bias requires careful data set curation and ongoing evaluation. Techniques include using diverse training data, testing outcomes for disparate impact and correcting any biased decision rules.

Ensure the content you curate while using AI does not amplify biases or violate human rights, accessibility, or fairness obligations you have at the university. Explainable (Transparency) There is a need for transparency in how AI systems make decisions or produce outputs . For users and organizations to trust AI, they should be able to get some insight into what data was used and how the model works. This is difficult with complex models (the “black box” problem), but efforts like Explainable AI (XAI) aim to provide human-understandable explanations for AI decisions. Transparency also involves being clear when content is generated or consumed by AI.

As part of your question you can ask for an explanation to be included in the answer. For example, \"What is the best time to visit Vancouver? Explain your reasoning \". SFU Guidance Transparency in AI builds trust and enables scrutiny. Users must be able to understand how AI systems work, verify their outputs, and justify decisions informed by AI. You are responsible for verifying responses provided by AI. If you are unable to verify and explain results, then consider not using them. You remain responsible for the execution and transparency of decisions informed or made by AI Solutions. Ensure AI generated content doesn't falsely impersonate or misrepresent you, others, or any other additional commitments you have (such as copyrighted content). Be transparent when others are interacting with AI generated content created vs. human generated content. Mark outputs with significant impact as AI-generated. Clearly inform people when AI is used in decision-making, with recourse options available. Auditable(Safety & Reliability) AI should be reliable and safe , meaning it performs as intended under expected conditions and fails gracefully under unexpected conditions. For instance, if an AI system controls a vehicle or provides medical advice, it must undergo rigorous testing and auditing to handle edge cases and avoid dangerous failures. Safety also involves the AI not causing harm through its output. In generative AI, safety can mean preventing the AI from generating violent or illegal instructions, hate speech, or disinformation. SFU Guidance AI systems must be regularly reviewed to ensure reliability and safety. Auditing allows issues to be identified early and supports responsible oversight and continuous improvement.

If you are using an AI solution, ensure results or content it generates adheres to legal commitments, code of ethics, or other responsibilities you have in your role at the university. It will be incumbent on you to audit your use of AI in a reliable and safe manner. AI itself cannot take responsibility. When developing and supporting AI solutions that will be used by others, understand your responsibility to maintain them in a reliable and safe manner. Establish regular audits and testing to ensure your AI solution does not cause harm (such as disinformation, hate speech, or violent/illegal instructions). Remain informed about the limitations of AI solutions you use and assess whether they are suitable for your use. AI systems can provide inaccurate results if they aren't built for your context. Inclusive AI should be designed to empower as many people as possible and avoid marginalizing any group . This principle emphasizes user-centric design – making AI accessible and useful to people with diverse backgrounds and abilities. For example, inclusive AI might involve ensuring that a voice assistant works for different accents and speech patterns, or that generative AI tools are available in many languages. In the context of responsible AI, inclusivity overlaps with fairness, but also encourages broad stakeholder input when designing AI (so that many perspectives are considered). SFU Guidance AI systems should be designed to serve people of all backgrounds and abilities.

Forms and tickets can be submitted directly through the bot. If the bot cannot provide a satisfactory answer, consider rephrasing or simplifying your question. If that does not work, your inquiry may require further support from Service Desk. You can close the chat window at any time or type “End” to finish the conversation.

To request a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for an AI-enabled tool, please see the overview and forms here: Privacy Impact Assessments Concerns and considerations when using AI applications that do not have an SFU PIA When using an AI application that does not have an SFU PIA as indicated in the above table, always keep in mind these six considerations: Unauthorized data collection BC’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) strictly prohibits unauthorized collection, use and disclosure of Personal information. The scope of “Personal information” is fairly broad, and includes information such as name, image, marital or family status, unique identifying numbers, demographic information (gender, race, ethnicity, religion), educational history, employment history and job performance, personal contact information, financial history, medical history, disability status, an individual's recorded personal views or opinions, and anyone else's recorded views and opinions about an individual. The ease of accidentally using or disclosing personal data is a significant concern, especially if the data is used for purposes beyond what the user initially agreed to at the original point of collection, such as unwanted targeted advertising or profile generation. Surveillance and tracking AI applications can be used for monitoring individuals online and in the physical world, raising significant concerns about mass surveillance and loss of privacy. Data that you enter into GenAI-enabled software applications can be used to deliver highly targeted advertisements, influence decision-making (e.g., what content you see), or even predict future behaviour. In some cases, this tracking extends beyond the application itself, following users across websites and devices using tracking pixels, cookies, and device fingerprints.", "token_count": 300}

In some cases, this tracking extends beyond the application itself, following users across websites and devices using tracking pixels, cookies, and device fingerprints. Data breaches and leaks AI systems often store and analyze large datasets. Therefore, they are attractive targets for hackers and cybercriminals. If an AI system containing medical, educational, or financial information is breached, Personal or Confidential information could be exposed. This threatens individual privacy and can lead to identity theft and financial fraud. Report such breaches to Information Security Services via SFU ServiceHub and the Privacy Management Program . Automated decision-making and loss of human oversight AI can improve efficiency and decision-making, but excessive reliance on AI without human oversight can have serious consequences. AI can potentially be used to support business activities such as hiring employees, or assessing student university admissions, by making decisions based on data patterns. However, these decisions may lack transparency, making it difficult for individuals to understand the outcome or question the results of the analyses, or to recognize any biases that may have influenced the decision. This leads to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly if AI is trained on biased data. If you are going to use AI to make a decision, you need to be prepared to defend the decision and the decision-making process. Threats to Information Security Ensure the use of generative AI complies with other SFU Policies such as Information Systems Policy GP24: Acceptable Use and Security of Digital Information and Electronic Systems , including the Information Security Standards .

However, that version of mod_auth_cas does not support Apache 2.4, so you are stuck with the older non-maintained version of Apache. There are a few other things to keep in mind if you want to continue using the old SFU version of mod_auth_cas. For example, in order to do the authorization, the SFU modified mod_auth_cas uses an SFU added feature of CAS, and adds an \"allow=\" string to the login and serviceValidate CAS entry points. We have added support for this to CAS 5 to continue to support the old mod_auth_cas, but this may not be supported in future upgrades to CAS. Another thing to keep in mind is that mod_auth_cas needs attributes from CAS to do the authorization work. The older versions of CAS didn't return attributes, so SFU modified CAS so that you could get the needed attributes from serviceValidate. In CAS 5, attributes are returned using p3/serviceValidate, but not with serviceValidate. We have added a setting in CAS 5 to allow some attributes to be returned by serviceValidate, and this setting will be set for those services that were using the old SFU mod_auth_cas before the upgrade to CAS 5.

The first thing to do before upgrading is to read Using mod_auth_cas at SFU to get an idea how the new module works and where to get it. Once you have the new mod_auth_cas downloaded, built and installed, you need to make sure that you have set CASValidateURL to p3/serviceValidate like this: CASValidateURL https://cas.sfu.ca/cas/p3/serviceValidate The next step is to check if you have specified Authtype Basic when using mod_auth_cas. This was allowed in the old SFU mod_auth_cas so that you could use Apache basic authentication in conjunction with CAS when controlling access to a non-web application such as WebDAV. This is not supported in the new mod_auth_cas, but we have made available a simple authentication module mod_authn_cas which will handle this use case. See this page for information on mod_authn_cas . Using \"Basic\" was also allowed in certain circumstances as equivalent to \"CAS\". If that was how it was being used, simply use \"Authtype CAS\" instead. Next, check to see if you use AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd to point to a file containing userid/password entries. The old mod_auth_cas would let you use these .htpasswd files to specify IDs or maillists to control access. The new mod_auth_cas doesn't support these .htpasswd files, so see the following table for replacing items in the .htpasswd file with Require lines.

Some client libraries are available to ease the use of CAS even further. Before you begin to integrate your application with CAS, however, you should understand a few details about the way CAS operates. First and more importantly, CAS is unlike many familiar authentication systems because it is not simply a password-validation tool. In a traditional environment, your web application will ask users for an ID and a password, and it will then call logic to determine whether this ID/password pair is valid. With CAS, however, your application never gains access to the user's password; to improve system-wide security, users supply their passwords only to the CAS server directly. Therefore, using CAS in your application may be more circuitous than you initially imagine, though be assured that the process is still straightforward and easy to master. When you first encounter a new user (e.g., one that has not yet established a session with your application), you'd normally display a username/password form in HTML. With CAS, you don't do this; instead, you simply redirect the user's browser to CAS's login URL, which is https://cas.sfu.ca/cas/login CAS then authenticates the user. If authentication fails – e.g., if the user cannot supply a correct password – then you’ll never hear from the user again. Instead, the user will remain at CAS’s site and will have the option to choose various “help” links that point to IT Services help sites to help them deal with computing account problems. Only if a user successfully authenticates does that user’s browser return to your application. Specifically, the user returns because CAS redirects the browser back to your application.

Only if a user successfully authenticates does that user’s browser return to your application. Specifically, the user returns because CAS redirects the browser back to your application. CAS knows how to find your application because when you initially redirected the user to CAS, you supplied a service parameter, in the form https://cas.sfu.ca/cas/login?service=http://my/url (Note that any metacharacters in your service URL, such as question marks, ampersands, and equals signs, must be escaped appropriately using the standard URL encoding algorithm: %26 for &, %3D for =, and %3F for ?. This will be necessary if your service URL contains parameters of its own. Note also that while it is necessary that you use HTTPS to safeguard your own application's authentication in secure environments, CAS's overall security is not weakened if your application merely uses HTTP; instead, CAS still authenticates the user securely.) When CAS redirects the authenticated user back to your application, it will append a parameter named ticket to your URL. For instance, the URL you supplied CAS may be called as follows: http://my/url?ticket=ST-92834-m34Aa83f7a3f We call this ticket opaque because, unlike an X.509 certificate or a Kerberos TGT, it is not possible for your application to decipher its meaning in isolation or from first principles. It has no internal structure useful to your application. The only thing you can do with this ticket is to send it back to CAS, which involves opening an HTTPS connection to https://cas.sfu.ca/cas/serviceValidate and sending two query parameters: service, which must match the service URL you initially supplied to CAS when redirecting the user there, and ticket, which is the ticket you just received.

In the latter case, CAS also supplies information about the user in an XML document, most notably the account that the user logged in with. Note that this final connection to CAS occurs directly between your application and CAS; your application opens a socket connection and retrieves information from the CAS server. You do not redirect the browser; you speak directly to CAS, effectively closing the loop and completing the authentication process.

Typically, applications will want to track users just as they would if they’d validated a user’s password themselves. That is, you’ll probably want to establish your own session – using application-specific, in-memory cookies or a similar mechanism – right after you validate a user’s authenticity with CAS. CAS is a single sign-on facility; once a user authenticates to CAS, the user need not continue to supply a password for other applications that redirect the user to CAS. However, CAS is not a “single sign-off” facility; a user that logs out of CAS will still have access to your application if your application keeps a persistent session with the user. CAS does offer a Single Sign Out option, which, when activated, will notify an application that a user has logged out of CAS. The application can then terminate any remaining local sessions as well. See the Jasig documentation for more details. CAS does provide a “logout” URL that the user may visit; loading the URL causes CAS to forget about the user’s prior authentication.

Why is my video taking a long time to become available? Once your file is finished uploading to SFU's servers, it usually needs to be re-processed into a format that is optimised for on-demand streaming. Processing times average well under an hour, but some things can affect this processing time. SFU is continually looking to improve the performance of the Mediasite platform. Below are some things to watch out for when uploading videos. An incorrect file was uploaded (e.g. uploading a PowerPoint . pptx file instead of a video file) Uploading very large, uncompressed video files. If you are using a video editor, try exporting with a lower bitrate (we recommend 1.5 Mbps) Sometimes, the wait is happening before the processing stage. If the status of the video lists \"Queued for Processing\", then your video has not yet begun processing. This wait time can go above the usual 10-20 minutes when too many people are uploading at the same time. If your video spends too much time waiting in the queue, try uploading your content at a different time of day. When making videos using Zoom or PowerPoint it is important to acquire a video file. If a non-video file is uploaded to Mediasite you will not receive an error. Mediasite will keep trying to convert the file but will fail after a long time. Zoom Recordings When using the Zoom local recording feature, Zoom will create a special temporary file. This file will end with \" .zoom \". After a recording finishes, please allow Zoom some time to process this file and produce a file that ends with \". mp4 \" PowerPoint Recordings Microsoft PowerPoint will allow you to make a recording of your presentation.

For best results, see \"1. Recommend video settings for faster upload\" above. 3. How many videos can i upload? In response to the rapid transition to remote teaching, SFU has removed any storage quotas for videos uploaded to Mediasite until further notice. 4. What kind of files can I upload? Mediasite accepts a wide variety of video and audio formats. Popular formats that are supported are listed below.

How much can I upload? In response to the rapid transition to remote teaching, SFU has removed any storage quotas for videos uploaded to Mediasite until further notice. 5. How long can I keep videos? ITS will delete class recordings that are more than one year old, but any content you upload yourself will remain available for as long as your SFU account remains active. Class recordings and uploads can be downloaded to your own computer or transferred to your My Mediasite account for long-term storage. 3. Viewing and Sharing Content 6. Who can see my videos? Visibility for your uploaded videos can be managed through My Mediasite. Use the \"Who can view?\" toggle to set the type of security. Limiting access to particular users or groups can be done using the \"Share Presentation\" or \"Edit Security\" buttons and adding your user or group as a \"Viewer\". By setting the toggle to \"Only Me\", visibility can be disabled temporarily in case you need to make adjustments to a video before distributing to your students. Videos will still appear wherever they are listed, but will not be allow playback until visibility is re-enabled. 7. Why is my video taking a long time to become available? Once your file is finished uploading to SFU's servers, it usually needs to be re-processed into a format that is optimised for on-demand streaming. Processing times average well under an hour, but some things can affect this processing time. SFU is continually looking to improve the performance of the Mediasite platform.

Thanks, Apple! :-( This means that printers need to be manually managed on newer versions of Mac OS X. If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, here’s how: 1. Don’t use Apple’s Print GUI to add printers! You’ll see a list of printers on the network broadcasting their names via “Bonjour”. If you try to add one of these printers, they won’t work ! You need to use the print server. 2. Point your web browser to https://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/ in order to see what printers are available. Pick out a printer that you want to add. For illustration, suppose it is the “ensc1” printer, which is an HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819. Assuming you have admin access to your Mac, open a Terminal and type the following: sudo /usr/sbin/lpadmin -p ensc1 -v ipp://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca/printers/ensc1 -D \"ensc1: HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819\" -L \"ASB 9819\" -E The ensc1 printer will now be available for printing to.

In other words, only a small set of hosts (namely, the print servers and other administrative servers) are allowed to access the printers via the network. Additionally, rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca is able to restrict specific printers to specific user groups (or SFU maillists ).

SFU_Print has its own access control system that is independent from the Research Computing Group. Contact its-papercut-help@sfu.ca for more information. Printer Accounting The rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca print server logs all print jobs, and once per month an accounting summary for each printer is automatically e-mailed to corresponding Lab Administrators and/or Departmental Administrators.

Although some VNC clients, such as RealVNC on Windows do support encryption, it won’t help if the server doesn’t! In order to protect users from this risk, we firewall the VNC ports on Ubuntu servers. You therefore must tunnel the VNC ports via SSH. (Those of you who used VNC with CentOS 6 servers might have avoided tunneling because the default VNC packaged with CentOS 6 is tigervnc, which does support encryption.) SSH tunneling is easily done on the command-line of any Linux or Mac workstation.

Choose an unused TCP port on your client workstation that you’d like to use to tunnel SSH to your VNC server on. Let’s say it’s 9999. Suppose that your VNC server’s hostname is “myserver.mydomain.sfu.ca” and that your username is “user”. In Terminal 1, type: ssh -L 9999:myserver.mydomain.sfu.ca:22 user@rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca and log into rcga-linux-ts1. Now port 9999 on your client workstation or home computer talks to port 22 on your VNC server via our Linux Terminal Server. Let’s suppose that your VNC server is using virtual desktop number 4. That means that it’s listening on TCP port 5904. In Terminal 2, type: ssh -L 5904:127.0.0.1:5904 -p 9999 user@127.0.0.1 and log into 127.0.0.1 (which is actually myserver.mydomain.sfu.ca.) This will tunnel port 5904 on your home computer or client workstation to port 5904 on your VNC server (through the port 9999 tunnel that you set up). NOTE that you must tunnel via rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca if you are off campus or on wireless, because direct SSH access to hosts on campus is in general blocked (and so are the VNC ports). Step #5: Connect Your VNC Client To The Local End Of The Tunnel Assuming your virtual desktop is 4 , connect your VNC client to 127.0.0.1:4 . This is the local end of the tunnel. Use your VNC password set in step #2. The data will be fully encrypted via ssh all the way to your VNC server.

Q #10: Do I Need To Worry About Kerberos On Linux Servers? On many Linux Servers, your NFSv4 home directory is mounted without Kerberization . This includes all the Colony Cluster nodes . Cluster jobs may run for weeks or sometimes months. We wouldn’t want you to have to renew your Kerberos Ticket every 10 hours in order to keep your jobs running! Most other Linux Servers, including the Linux terminal servers (rcg-linux-ts1.rcg.sfu.ca & rcg-linux-ts2.rcg.sfu.ca) , will use Kerberization , with the exception of rcg-linux-ts3.rcg.sfu.ca , which we are providing without Kerberization for the convenience of those users who need to run long-term jobs, such as screen or tmux . Q #11: Why Do We Have To Suffer The Inconvenience Of Kerberos On Linux Workstations? Non-Kerberized NFS is inherently insecure , in that anybody with sudo access to a Linux computer can su to another user and read/modify the contents of their home directory. Most of our Linux Servers are locked up in a server room with restricted physical access, and only trusted IT staff have sudo access. This minimizes the risk and therefore we can allow many of these servers to use non-Kerberized NFS . The Linux Workstations, on the other hand, have a more liberal policy with regards to who is granted sudo access. This is because Faculty members often demand sudo access to their own Workstations, and Lab Administrators of various research labs need to install software for their users. In order to accomodate this greater risk, we need to use Kerberized NFSv4 on all the Linux Workstations.", "token_count": 262}

If you fail to do this, any valid Kerberos Tickets will remain in the Kerberos Ticket cache . On computers that are using file-based Kerberos Ticket caches, these will be files in /tmp. Anybody with sudo access to the Linux workstation could potentially use these these kerberos ticket cache files to access your home directory! Even if you do kdestroy there are often other Kerberos Ticket caches that get generated by various activities. They may also be stored in /tmp. To be safe, it is best to take a look in /tmp and make sure that there are no files there belonging to you starting with krb5cc_ . If there are, delete them. Q #19: Why Can I Still Read My Home Directory After Destroying My Kerberos Tickets? kdestroy will instantly remove your Kerberos Tickets from a cache file in /tmp/.

Though we don't make any particular guarantees or provide official support for these products, these have all been used on campus: Dreamweaver and other web publishing packages typically have their own WebDAV support built in and are compatible with the SFU WebDAV server. If you are using such a package to design your pages, it is often simplest to use the \"remote site\" connection to update your site, which avoids the use of the OS WebDAV support altogether. Free 3rd party clients such as BitKinex operate correctly, and are often faster than the built-in WebDAV support Paid, commercial WebDAV-client implementations such as WebDrive have additional features that may be useful, such as the ability to mount a WebDAV space as a \"drive letter\" in Windows", "token_count": 196}

There is also the option of “remembering” your MFA sign-in for seven days. Even if an attacker obtains your password, they won’t be able to complete the login process without the time-based code. This is how MFA acts as an additional layer of defense to protect against unauthorized access to your data.

Team members may have different constraints that may affect response times. Take note of your team member’s availability status. They may need to focus on other tasks and may not respond to your message immediately as a result. Be polite, professional and respectful in all your conversations. The use of images, memes, emojis, stickers and GIFs can convey different tones. Use them mindfully. The use of ALL CAPS can signal yelling or shouting. Use them appropriately. Use @mentions mindfully. If you need a team member’s attention to read or reply, using mentions (@name) is appropriate. Only use channel-wide mentions (@channels) or team-wide mentions (@team) if you are requesting attention from the entire team. This creates a notification for everyone in that channel/team. Consider using the emoji reaction button to acknowledge a message in place of short replies. Make use of the reply button when posting a reply to a conversation in a channel. Posting your reply as a new message (instead of using the reply button) can make the conversation more difficult to follow. Keep channel conversations relevant to that channel’s purpose and topic. For ad hoc conversations, consider using the chat function instead of posting messages in channels. Meetings and Calls Strive to start and end calls/meetings on time. If you are an attendee and anticipate that you will be late for a call/meeting, notify the meeting organizer ahead of time with a quick chat message. Mute yourself when you are not speaking. There may be background sounds that you may not be aware", "token_count": 300}

There may be background sounds that you may not be aware of, but others may hear. Leave a message in the meeting chat if you joined late or need to leave early, instead of interrupting the speaker by announcing it verbally. Utilize background effects (or blurred background) if there are visual distractions in your video background. Select an appropriate background effect based on your audience. If you are eating or doing tasks that can be visually distracting to others, consider turning off your camera. Teams and Channels For Team Members Be mindful about who you are inviting into your team. New team members will be able to see all previous messages and files on public channels. If you are not a Team Owner, it is best to inform your Team Owner before inviting people to a team. It is best to speak with the team owner(s) before creating a new channel . If there are certain files or conversations that are should only be accessed by specific team members, consider creating a private channel . Only upload and share files that are relevant to your team or project. For your own files that are unrelated to the team, you can store them in your own OneDrive account. For Team Owners Before requesting a new team , have a conversation with your local IT staff or whomever may be overseeing the collection of teams for your faculty/department/unit.

Let's draft a structure for the team → Additional tips for group-managed teams If you plan on syncing a new security group to your new team, please create and activate it prior to submitting a team request . Submitting a team request with an unactivated security group can lead to technical issues in your team. If you plan on syncing your department's security group to your new team, we recommend nesting your department's security group inside a new security group. This ensures that people who are outside of your department can be added to your team without being added to your department's security group.

Although SFU Zoom is not a remote proctoring software it can: • mimic physical observation that occurs during in-person exams • confirm which student is taking the exam • be a reminder of academic integrity guidelines at SFU. Note that when SFU Zoom or any other method is used for live proctoring the session must not be recorded. The strongest recommendation for ensuring academic integrity is exams and exam questions that are tailored to require unique student reflection and work. There are also a number of features in Canvas that can be leveraged to discourage cheating or make it more difficult to cheat on exams. To learn more, please visit https://www.sfu.ca/cee/services/online-exam-options.html or reach out to the Centre for Educational Excellence for advice. The following guidelines have been developed by CEE and ITS to ensure a reasonably seamless experience using SFU Zoom for live remote proctoring.

Please note, that the most effective way to add them is by entering their computingID@sfu.ca rather than their e-mail alias.

Preparation for Proctoring Session Conduct a practice session at least 24 hours prior to the exam period so that you can test out your proctoring solution and ensure everything is working properly. We recommend that you do this as early as possible. Your practice session will be self-serve and should replicate the conditions of the actual exam. CEE and ITS staff will not be able to coordinate this session for you. This session is a great time to remind students of exam expectations so that they are prepared when they begin the exam or could be used as a study session. Proctors should join prior to all students. Assign any co-hosts during the session. Students should be informed to join the session at least 30 minutes early to allow for troubleshooting and resolution of technical issues. We recommend that you have a contingency plan for how you will handle technical issues that may occur during the session. Starting the Session The proctor will log-in and begin the session In the top right hand corner, you can change the view to gallery view so that you will see a grid of all the students joining the call.

Communicate exam expectations. Ideally these will be shared both in the course communications, and in the practice session but it is valuable to re-iterate these expectations prior to beginning the exam. Expectations will include but are not limited to: a. How to ask questions to the proctor b. What to do when the exam is completed c. What is allowed or not allowed during the exam (e.g. using scratch paper, calculators, notes, etc.) During the Exam Proctors can click on individual students’ video boxes to expand the view of that student.

If you anticipate that many students will need to use this, you can have TAs in the breakout room(s) ready to assist.

For students, the necessary applications are pre-installed on our computer lab machines. If you do not have a professional web publishing application, we recommend using one of the free file transfer applications listed below: WinSCP or PuTTY for Windows Cyberduck and FileZilla for Mac OS .

What is a service? What is a service owner? What is a service offering? What is a service offering owner? Service Taxonomy The IT Services service catalogue houses all services (active and retired) using an IT service catalogue framework adapted from the EDUCAUSE paper The Higher Education IT Service Catalog: A Working Model for Comparison and Collaboration . This framework is a shared body of knowledge that leverages expertise, research and standards from the higher education IT sector to help institutions overcome common service catalogue challenges. What is a Service Category? \"A logical grouping of services that benefit from being managed together. These high-level groupings should be meaningful to the IT service provider to facilitate budgeting and governance of services. Some institutions might choose to make these groupings visible to end users, whereas some might not and might even have different groupings (see the discussion of \"views\" earlier in this document). These categories should reflect the strategic goals of the institution and align with the overall governance model. Governance of IT services, including deciding on major projects, developing strategy, and managing funding, is generally conducted by groups aligned with the service categories. Most service catalogs will consist of six to ten service categories. Examples of service categories might include communication and collaboration, infrastructure, and teaching and learning.\" - The Higher Education IT Service Catalogue Model (ECAR) Service categories accomplish multiple goals. Firstly, they help IT Services (ITS) represent the work being done. For example, ITS may have 10 services dedicated to infrastructure or 20 services dedicated to learning technologies. Secondly, they act as a logical grouping for services so they can be discovered through exploration. However, it's important to keep in mind that the vast majority of services are found through direct searching.", "token_count": 300}

Secondly, they act as a logical grouping for services so they can be discovered through exploration. However, it's important to keep in mind that the vast majority of services are found through direct searching. To avoid category confusion and paralysis, ITS takes a best-fit approach for services that can span multiple categories. What is a Service? \" An end-to-end IT service that delivers value to customers, typically not identified by specific product or application names. The service combines people, processes, and technology to provide outputs or results that enable business capabilities or an end user's work activities and desired outcomes. \" - The Higher Education IT Service Catalogue Model (ECAR) In summary, a service is the management of people, process and technology to deliver something valuable to another group so they don’t have to take on the associated costs or risks. For example, IT Services may manage a student application system by offering a service that takes care of the maintenance, updates, and security on behalf of Student Services. This provides something valuable without that group needing to take on additional resources. What is a Service Owner (SO)? \"A service owner is accountable for the delivery of an IT service and the service offerings within. The purpose of this leadership role is to ensure that the service receives strategic attention and appropriate resources to support the mission and needs of the institution. The SO is responsible for the service as a whole through its entire life cycle and is accountable to the person in charge of overall IT service delivery.

These can be software bundles, custom application solutions, or other technology that enables a service offering. Multiple service offerings might exist for a single service.\" - The Higher Education IT Service Catalogue Model (ECAR) For example, a service managing campus printers may offer a way to: Request repairs Assign a new printing key FOB Deploy a new printer to an office What is a Service Offering Manager (SOM)? \"A service offering manager is a boots-on-the-ground role that is responsible for the delivery of an IT service offering.

How to Configure Remote Access for Managed Macs These instructions are for connecting a remote Mac to a managed Mac on campus. Apple provides a fairly simple resource for remote control like Microsoft does with Windows \"Remote Desktop\". It is not as feature-rich or mature as Microsoft Remote Desktop but it gets the job done. Note : Macs can use simple VNC, but we will never use this . We will allow the Screen Sharing service. When we do, we should take extra measures to tunnel through SSH to ensure it is encrypted. One thing to look out for: The majority (over 85%) of managed Macs at the University are already configured for Remote Management . Both services cannot be configured simultaneously , so the route you take will depend on how your Mac is currently configured. With Apple screen sharing the user ID and password are sent encrypted, as are keystrokes and mouse movements. Scenario 1: No Screen Sharing or Remote Management configured Open System Preferences > Sharing Click on Screen Sharing Be sure to only allow access for your main user Stop here. Do not ever enable VNC Note : We are NOT configuring VNC access at SFU, and doing so reduces security of our systems. Never, ever promote this practice.

Features of MS Teams include team chat or channels, one-on-one chat, document collaboration, video meetings, and integration with other Microsoft applications. When used as directed by this guideline, MS Teams can reduce reliance on email, facilitate document sharing, enable remote access, and support document synchronization. This guide provides SFU employees with resources to help share, organize, manage, retain, and dispose of the information they create using MS Teams in accordance with records management best practice. Roles and Responsibilities As a public body, SFU has a responsibility to create and keep records that document its decision-making and business activities. MS Teams is a communication and collaboration tool; it does not have the necessary functionality and controls to be considered a record keeping system. Therefore, when working in MS Teams: employees are responsible for ensuring that the critical information they create or receive is filed in their departments record keeping system; and departments are responsible for maintaining a reliable record-keeping system, such as a Shared Network Drive, SharePoint on Premise Site, OnBase, etc. M365 and the Records Management Lifecycle The records management lifecycle is a framework that describes the distinct phases of a record's existence, from creation to final disposition. At SFU there are several different tools that individuals and departments can use to create, use, maintain and retain records. OneDrive allows account holders to securely store, share and synchronise their individual files and folders from any device.

MS Teams is a communication and collaboration tool. MS Teams can be used during the creation and use phase of the records management lifecycle. Once records reach the maintenance and retention phase of their lifecycle they can be transferred into a shared records repository (Shared Network Drives, ERMS, etc.) or continued to be managed in place in Teams. More guidance about records repositories is in development. Please visit the Records Management Links and Resources page for more information. As ITS continues to introduce new Microsoft 365 services, additional tools for managing electronic records, will be made available. For more information see Microsoft 365 at SFU Roadmap . MS Teams Site Management Each MS Teams site passes through the following four phases: planning; documenting and implementing; using and maintaining; and final disposition. Listed below are record-keeping best practices MS Teams site owners and users should keep in mind during each phase. Planning MS Teams sites should be established with the final disposition of both the site and the content on the site in mind. Since MS Teams sites are not intended for long-term storage of official university records, site administrators should have a plan in place for transferring records when they enter the maintenance and retention phase of the records management lifecycle.", "token_count": 269}

When will records be transferred from the site to the department’s records repository? Who will decide when the site is inactive and ready to be deleted? Documenting and Implementing Create a management plan for your MS Teams site and ensure it is shared with all site members. A management plan should include the following information: Purpose of the site Membership of the site Channel names and description Permissions structure for the site and channels Folder structure Naming convention (consult the Standard Naming Convention for Electronic Records for more information ) Records retention requirements Plan for transferring records from the site to the department’s records repository Plan for how to identify when the site is inactive Plan for deleting the site Using and Maintaining Uploading Documents Documents can be uploaded to a MS Teams site, to a specific Channel, shared in Channel posts, and shared in one-to-one chat. This can create file duplication and make finding information difficult. By establishing a folder structure and maintaining a consistent filing system, departments can reduce duplication and facilitate access to the records they create and store in MS Teams. Tips Keep your folder structure simple. Avoid nested folder structures of more than two levels. Keep in mind the purpose of your site - do not set up directories which are out of scope. Upload documents to the appropriate folder and then share links. This will help avoid duplicating documents. Keep in mind that files uploaded within Channels are stored in an associated SharePoint library. However, files shared within one-to-one chat messages are stored in OneDrive.", "token_count": 300}

If you download a document, make changes and then re-upload it, a new version will be created. If you edit a document online, a new version will be created. If there are multiple editors making changes to the same document off-line, it may be necessary to merge versions to ensure all changes are captured. Departments may want to consider internal procedures for how they collaborate on documents to avoid confusion. At the moment, ITS and Microsoft have not limited the number of versions saved for a single document. This may change in the future. Departments may want to consider internal procedures for saving important drafts outside of MS Teams. Channels MS Teams are made up of Channels, which are the “spaces” where group conversations and document collaboration take place. Channels can help Teams users classify and organize content created and/or uploaded in Teams. Each channel should be dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project and structured to encourage targeted content development. For example, establish a channel for a specific project or an event (for example, Department Website Redesign, or Fall Convocation 2023 Planning). Chat MS Teams also includes a 1:1 chat feature, which allows users to chat directly with another person. Reminder Files uploaded using chat are stored in OneDrive. Limit the amount of personal information shared using chat as chat conversations are subject to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.

Documenting Decision Making The chat and channels features should not be used for formal decision-making (e.g., contract negotiation, policy approval, etc.). These tools were created with document collaboration and communication in mind and not for documenting official direction or approvals. Retention policies for MS Teams are under development. Once finalized, new policies may impact the length of time chats are retained. As such, users should not count on chats to be permanently available. Therefore, formal decision-making should be documented in meeting minutes, email correspondence, memos, briefing notes, etc., and stored in a centrally accessible location (e.g., meeting minutes stored on a department’s Shared Network Drive). If, however, a formal decision is made using chat or channels users should ensure that the decision is captured (e.g., screen shot, follow-up email, etc.) and that all of the correct members of a team are informed of the decision and have access to the necessary records. Recording Meetings Like Zoom, MS Teams includes an option for recording meetings. There are many privacy considerations that should be addressed prior to recording a meeting. Staff meetings, academic advising sessions, job interviews etc., have not typically been recorded at SFU. The Archives strongly recommends against recording meetings for the purposes of administrative convenance or as a means of compiling meeting minutes and notes. For more information about recording meetings see Zoom Privacy and Security . Although developed for Zoom, these guidelines can be applied to MS Teams. Final Disposition As mentioned previously, MS Teams is not considered a long-term storage repository for official university records.

Refer to the Records Retention Schedules and Disposition Authorities (RRSDAs) and Official, Transitory and Personal Records: A Guide for SFU Employees. for additional information about retention and disposition requirements. Tips Once collaboration has been completed, ensure that records are saved in your departments record keeping system. Be aware that when a Channel is deleted, any files shared within the channel are still stored in the associated SharePoint library connected to the Teams Site. Therefore, administrators need to delete all documents from the library which are not meant to be retained as records. Records on Teams sites should not be retained longer that what is outlined in the RRSDAs. Get into the habit of doing routine disposition checks, during which you delete files you no longer need and save those that you do need to keep to your department’s records repository. Create channels with a known conclusion in mind; this makes it easier to set aside a specific date for capturing and transferring records. Access and Privacy All information created or received in MS Teams is subject to access requests under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA) and must be produced in the case of a FOIPPA access request, this includes messages shared in chats and channels.

At SFU, there are several different tools that individuals and departments can use to create, use, maintain, and retain records. OneDrive allows account holders to securely store, share and synchronise their individual files and folders from any device. OneDrive can be used during the creation and use phase of the records management lifecycle. MS Teams is a communication and collaborative tool. MS Teams can be used during the creation and use phase of the records management lifecycle. For more information see MS Teams Best Practices. Once records reach the maintenance and retention phase of their lifecycle, they can be transferred into a shared records repository (such as a Shared Network Drives, ERMS, etc.) or they can continue to be managed in place in Teams. More guidance about records repositories is in development. Please visit the Records Management Links and Resources page for more information. As ITS continues to introduce new Microsoft 365 services, additional tools for managing electronic records, such as SharePoint Online, will be made available.

Follow a similar file naming convention in your OneDrive as used elsewhere by your department. For tips on file naming see Standard Naming Conventions for Electronic Records . Keep your folder structure simple, ideally no more than two levels of nesting folders. Use your department’s file classification plan to name folders according to a predefined taxonomy. For tips on creating a file classification plan see Model File Classification Plan for University Records .

Tips for document sharing All documents stored in OneDrive remain linked to their original owner. If you leave SFU and your account is deactivated, the original documents will be difficult to recover if they have not already been stored elsewhere, regardless of whether they have been shared or not. You may share documents stored in OneDrive; however, be aware that anyone who is granted access to a document in OneDrive with editing privileges can share that file with others.

A data loss prevention (DLP) policy is a security boundary for data. In the context of the Microsoft Power Platform, a DLP policy is a set of technical guidelines for how data can flow between different apps via connectors. What are connectors? Connectors are no-code/low-code components that provide a way for the Microsoft Power Platform to communicate with other apps and services. When you set up a connector in a Power Automate workflow (also called \"flows\") or a Power Automate app, you are authorizing one service to talk to another. For example, you could have an automated flow that starts an approval process when a file is uploaded to SharePoint by using the SharePoint Online and MS Approvals connectors. In this case, each connector would be authorized to broker (or \"talk\") to each service so the flow can act on your behalf. Connectors are an empowering feature to enable personal productivity within Microsoft 365. If you are just getting started with connectors and want to learn more, explore the Get Started with Power Automate online resources from Microsoft. Why has SFU restricted some connectors? Access to data within the SFU community is diverse. In combination with our community's data responsibility guidelines , a baseline Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy is an automatic way of helping our community safely navigate connections between data using vetted (reviewed and approved) connectors, while avoiding the complications and risks that can lead to data abuse. In general, the baseline DLP policy for the Microsoft Power Platform will restrict any connector that: Hasn't undergone a privacy and security review (this includes new connectors).

Complete and submit this request form to initiate a request with IT Services. ( Note : Only for tools that are critical for research, learning, or other university business needs. Not applicable to tools used for individual preferences.) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why is SFU updating its IT standards? As technology evolves, it is crucial to continuously assess and adjust our IT standards in an evolving cybersecurity landscape. The updates to SFU IT standards are aligned with What’s Next: The SFU Strategy and SFU’s digital transformation goals , and are designed to enhanced cybersecurity measures and protect research, academic, and business data across the university. SFU is upgrading our email system to Exchange Online for better features and stronger security. As part of this change, every third-party application that connects to SFU Mail is considered a “system integration”. According to provincial requirements and the new IT standards, each of these integrations requires a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and a Security Assessment. What are the key changes starting Summer 2024? Starting in the Summer of 2024, SFU Mail will only connect with third-party apps/tools that have received a PIA and Security Assessment and have been approved for use in SFU's business, teaching, or research-critical activities. Any existing connections between SFU Mail and non-approved external tools/applications will stop working when your SFU Mail account is migrated to Exchange Online. Who will be affected by these changes? The changes will impact any member of the SFU community (e.g. staff, faculty, researchers, students, sponsored/role accounts, etc.) who currently use a third-party/external tool or application that connects to their SFU Mail for email or calendar-related activities.

For example: An application that sends emails using an SFU email account. Software that connects to your advising team’s mailboxes to manage appointment bookings, used for coordinating student advising. External tools or apps that will not be considered for approval (or for delay to SFU Mail migration) are typically used for personal preferences.

If you are a student (includes Alumni), staff, or faculty member leaving SFU for any reason other than retirement, your SFU Computing account will be converted into an SFU Limited Access ID account one year after your last active term (student) or end date (staff/faculty). Consequently, your SFU Mail account will be destroyed and its contents will no longer be recoverable. IT Services will send an email reminder 90 days, 45 days and 30 days prior to contents being removed. Setup instructions have been provided for the Thunderbird email client which is available for free on Windows, Mac, and Linux. How many emails do you have? If you have a small number of emails you'd like to keep, consider manually forwarding them to your personal email. We also recommend cleaning up your inbox to reduce the number of items that need to be downloaded and transferred over. Why use Mozilla Thunderbird? Mozilla Thunderbird is a free, open-source application that is available to everyone on Windows, Mac and Linux. Other applications, such as Outlook, may require licensing that may no longer be available after leaving the university. If you still have access to Outlook for Desktop and more comfortable with Outlook, consider visiting Microsoft Support on Export emails, contacts, and calendar items to preserve email content.

Security ensures that information is handled responsibly throughout the system’s lifecycle and that robust security controls are in place to prevent abuse. Use only university-reviewed systems when entering personal information into AI tools, to ensure compliance with institutional privacy and security standards. Conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for new AI solutions, and update PIAs if they have significantly changed. Apply security safeguards proportional to data sensitivity . While evaluating AI solutions, choose privacy-protective technologies. Accountable Organizations must remain answerable for how AI systems are developed and used.

Data hygiene while using Copilot When you're using Microsoft 365 and tools like Copilot, it's easy to forget how much information you're actually sharing and storing. That’s why it’s important to keep your data clean and organized.

Here are a few simple ways to stay on top of your data hygiene while using Microsoft 365. Guarding Against Oversharing Microsoft 365 is a great platform for collaboration and productivity, however, content owners may inadvertently share more content than they need (often called \" Oversharing \"). It will be important to consider the following when sharing content on the Microsoft 365 platform: Pick the right level of access for each link you make when you share a document. For example, you can share your work with anyone, only with people in your organization, or only the people you choose . If you create \"Anyone\" links that can be shared publicly, set an expiry date on the link . This means that your links will stop working after at time you define. This can help ensure that content isn't shared forever and reduces the burden of managing links overall. Regularly review your links using the \"My Content\" feature in the M365 portal. Under the \"Shared\" tab, you can filter through all the links you've made and who can use them. You can also change or delete any links that you don't need or want anymore. For an in-depth overview of how each link works while sharing information see: How shareable links work in OneDrive and SharePoint in Microsoft 365 .
