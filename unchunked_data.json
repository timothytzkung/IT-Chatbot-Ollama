Teams is already in use across the university as a meeting and instant messaging tool. This move is part of SFU’s ongoing efforts to enhance communication infrastructure and better accommodate the evolving faculty and staff needs at the university.\nWHAT I NEED TO KNOW\nTimeline:\nThe migration to MS Teams Phones will occur in phases to ensure a smooth transition. This change will primarily be automated, but staff will be provided with training, training resources and IT support to ensure a successful migration to Teams Phone usage.\nDue to their unique nature, each phase will be individually planned and executed. Following is the projected implementation sequence, with initial target dates.\nThe major elements of the transition include the following:\nPlanning and Preparation\nTelco Vendor Selection and Negotiation\nPrepare Funding, Support Models\nRefine and approve implementation approach\nImplementation / Roll-out\nImplementation will include:\nPilot- target Q1/2025\nFaculty and Staff, General office lines\nClassrooms and Meeting Spaces\nEmergency Phones\nSpecial Cases (as necessary)\nDecommissioning and Clean-up\nFollowing these phases, the university will start decommissioning obsolete equipment as part of the upgrade process.\nNote:\nThe implementation dates provided are tentative and subject to change.\nWhy this change:\nTransitioning to Microsoft Teams phones will improve our operational efficiency and collaboration. Some of the benefits include:\nSignificant Cost Savings:\nBy integrating phones into MS Teams, SFU will reduce its yearly phone expenses.\nCentralized Communications:\nOne platform to handle all forms of communications - calls, video conferencing, messaging, and file sharing - eliminates inefficiencies and complexity that comes with using multiple systems.\nImproved Call Management:\nWith MS Teams, users can manage their calls seamlessly across multiple devices - whether from a computer, smartphone, or tablet - and from any location, be it the office, home, or while traveling.\nRetention of Existing Phone Numbers:\nTo ensure continuity and convenience, all existing numbers will be migrated to the new system, making the transition smooth.\nTo learn more, see the\nFAQs\nor explore the\nHow-to-Guides\nsection.\nQuestions?

This article discusses how the standard ITIL and classifications work within the TeamDynamix system.\nDETAILS\nITIL Classification Definitions\nNote:\nThese various classifications can be renamed and switch-on or turn-off as necessary.\nClassification is in\nRed\nand highlighted in\nyellow\n, has been\nswitched-on\nwithin SFU ServiceHub, as of June 24, 2024\nService Request\n– A request from a user for information, advice, a standard change or access to an IT service. For example, to reset a password, or to provide standard IT services for a new user. Service requests are usually handled by a service desk, and do not require a Request for Change (RFC) to be to be submitted.\nIncident\n– An unplanned interruption to an IT service or a reduction in the quality of an IT service. Failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted one or more services is also an incident. For example, the failure of one disk from a mirror set.\nMajor Incident\n–\n[Not switched-on yet]\nAn event which significantly affects a business or organization, and which demands a response beyond the routine incident management process. A major incident is an incident that is either defined in the major incident procedure or which:\nAffects, or has the potential to affect services or systems that are critical to the business\nHas a significant effect on the reputation, legal compliance, regulation or security of the business/organization.\nProblem\n–\n[Not switched-on yet]\nThe cause of one or more incidents. The cause is not usually known when a problem record is created, and the problem management process is responsible for further investigation.\nChange\n– The addition, modification or removal of anything that could affect IT services. This includes all IT services, configuration items, processes, documentation, etc.\nRelease\n–\n[Not switched-on yet]\nA collection of hardware or software documentation, processes or other components required to implement one or more approved changes to IT services. The contents of each release are managed, tested, and deployed as a single entity.​\nUse in TeamDynamix\nLet’s look at a hypothetical use case that covers most of these definitions:\nThere are fifty incidents of WiFi being interrupted.\nThose incidents are then rolled up into a single problem ticket about the lack of suitable WiFi infrastructure.\nA change ticket could then be opened and the WiFi infrastructure can be changed or upgraded to be more resilient and reliable.\nA release ticket could then be created, and the institution could release new documentation and justification for the upgrade in WiFi infrastructure.\nThe institution could release the communication or news that the new WiFi infrastructure should be more consistent, and that there is no cause for concern.\nIn the below illustration, the interior\nblue\nsections of the pyramid show the hierarchy of what can be used as parent or child tickets in TeamDynamix.\nA\nparent ticket\ncan contain any of the child classifications below it. This means, for example, that a\nrelease\ncan contain any\nproblems,\nwithout a\nchange\nbetween them in the hierarchy.\nWhen a parent ticket (for example, a release) is updated, a technician can elect to update or close all the child tickets (for example, changes, problems, major incidents, and incidents or service requests) that are nestled within it.\nWhen a ticket is converted to a project task, any existing parent linkage is removed, but children tickets will remain. However, updates made to the ticket based on the corresponding project task's status will not be cascaded to its children.\nLastly, per the outer edges of the diagram, any classification of a ticket may have a service knowledge article, asset or configuration item associated with it.",

The group manager(s) can add or remove SFU email addresses (known as 'members' of the group) as needed.\nInstead of adding multiple email addresses on the To/CC/BCC field, EDGs enable you to use a single email address when sending messages to a group.\nExample:\nTo:\nperson1@sfu.ca;\nperson2@sfu.ca;\nperson3@sfu.ca\nTo:\nmy-distribution-group@sfu.ca\nREMINDER\nExchange Distribution Group\ncan only contain SFU members\n. If you require email distribution to non-SFU email recipients, such as Gmail email addresses, please see\nhere\nfor your options.\nAlternatively, you may also CC/BCC any non-SFU email recipients if you wish to use an Exchange Distribution Group.\nNote that University policy\nAcceptable Use and Security of Digital Information and Electronic Systems (GP 24)\ngoverns the use of all computing systems at SFU, including Exchange Distribution Groups. Exchange Distribution Groups are intended to be used in support of scholarly or work-related activity in accordance with this policy.\nTYPES OF DISTRIBUTION GROUPS\nStandard Group\nA distribution group that contains SFU email addresses or other SFU Groups.\nThese are general purpose email distribution groups.\nVideo (5 min)\nCourse Group\nA group that is automatically populated with the course roster for a course and section. Course groups always reflect the roster for the current term.\nThese are often used by instructors or teaching assistants to send emails to their student rosters (i.e., psyc102-d100@sfu.ca). When requested and created, sender restrictions are automatically set to the instructor. TAs will need to be manually added.\nVideo (7 min)\nAcademic Plan\nA group that is automatically kept up-to-date with the membership of one or more Academic Plans. Academic Plan group always reflect the Plan membership for the current term.\nThese are often used by administrative staff to send emails to various cohorts of students. Sender restriction is always enabled for these groups.\nVideo (2 min)\nWho can Request?\nAll requests for Exchange Distribution Group are reviewed and will be created within\none business day\nonce approved by IT Services.\nSTAFF AND FACULTY\nMay request\nStandard Groups\nfor instructional, administrative or research-related purposes.\nMay request\nC\nourse Groups\nor\nAcademic Plan Groups\nwhich automatically contains the registered students in a course or academic plan.\nSTUDENTS\nMay request\nStandard Groups\nthat are related to course work, SFSS-recognised clubs, or student unions.\nNew groups requested by students will only be approved if they clearly relate to course work, a SFSS-recognised club, or a student union. The course name/number (e.g. engl100 -- both department and number) or\nclub name/acronym\nmust appear in the group name, and the description should clearly indicate the purpose of the group.\nExamples of appropriate names and descriptions for student-run groups:\nengl100-mygroup\nStudy group for ENGL100 -- Rudyard Kipling group\nmyclub-exec\nSFSS Club myclub Executives contact maillist\nHow to Request\nSTEP 1\nBefore requesting a group, determine your group name and description beforehand. Here are guidelines on appropriate group naming:\nGroup Name\nYour group name must meet all of the following:\nClearly represent the purpose of the group\nContain at least one hyphen (-) character, but not start or end with it\nContain only letters, numbers, hyphens (no spaces and no other special characters)\nBe no more than 140 characters\nCan not conflict with any other SFU email address\nDescription\nYou must provide a short, clear description of the purpose of this group.\nINAPPROPRIATE NAMES\nSFU reserves the right to reject distribution group requests where the name of the group does not meet appropriate naming criteria; this includes, but is not limited to, group names that:\nare too general or non-specific\nattempt to masquerade as some other entity in the system\nare silly, frivolous or appear to have no relationship to any university activity\ncontain profanity\nconflict with the automatically populated \"course group\" naming patterns:\nDEPT-# (eg. phil-100)\nDEPT#-SECTION (eg. psyc102-d100)\nDEPT-#-SECTION (eg. cmpt-165-c100)\nSTEP 2\nGo to\ngroups.sfu.ca\nand select\nRequest an Exchange Distribution Group\n, or visit the request form:\nRequest New EDG\nSTEP 3\nOn the\nrequest form\n, choose the type of group you would like to request. Note that the option to request Course and Academic Plan groups may not be available to you, depending on your role at SFU. Continue by following the instructions on the request form.\nSTEP 4\nOnce submitted, Exchange Distribution Group (EDG) requests are manually reviewed by SFU IT staff to ensure compliance with SFU policies. We aim to act on requests within\none business day\n.\nYou will be notified by email when your group has been activated. Once activated, your EDG's email address is\nmy-distribution-group@sfu.ca.\nIn the meantime, you can visit your group on\ngroups.sfu.ca\nand make changes to the membership and other settings. If you made any changes to your EDG, you will need to wait an additional 30 minutes for the changes to fully sync to Microsoft servers.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor questions about Group Management or SFU Groups:\nVisit our\nSFU Groups FAQ\n.\nFor additional assistance:\nRequest a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nRelated Services / Offerings (2)\nEmail Distribution Lists\nTools that provides the ability to send email messages to multiple email addresses using a list or a group.\nGroup Management\nGroup Management simplifies access management by letting you use the same group or role across many services at SFU.",

If you need\nread-only access\n, you can visit the\nMaillist Staging/Test Environment\nto view your maillists (any modifications will have no impact).\nAny remaining maillists can\nno longer be used for emailing\nand its name is available on Exchange Distribution Groups for creation. To re-create your maillists as Exchange Distribution Groups,\nsend a request\non SFU Groups.\nAny remaining maillists used for\nsecurity (access control lists) will continue to function\non downstream systems to not interrupt business operations. However, they will eventually become stale since maillists can no longer be modified.\nAll active maillist used for email distribution have been automatically migrated between December 2024 to April 2025. IT Services have reached out to maillist owners and managers for next steps to migrate. You may or may not need to take action depending on how you use your maillist.\nFor technical users: the Maillist API will be shut down along with the retirement. However, the AOBRest (with a maillist endpoint) will continue running.\nWHEN IS THE MIGRATION?\nAdministrative units will have their\nactive maillist\nmigrated in December 2024.\nFaculty and academic units will have their\nactive maillist\nmigrated between January to April 2025. Maillist owners and managers will receive an email notification two weeks prior to migration.\nWHO IS AFFECTED?\nAnyone who owns or manages a maillist.

This also includes some safe-listed domains hosted by SFU, including @cs.sfu.ca and @rcg.sfu.ca.\nExternal recipients\n: Generally, refers to any email address that's not SFU. In technical terms, any other recipient that does not meet the \"internal recipient\" requirement.\nWhat is the difference between SFU Maillist and SFU Groups (Exchange Distribution Groups)?\nThe functional differences are:\nRestricted Senders Security\n: Enabling Restricted Senders on an Exchange Distribution Group will require any sender to authenticate to Exchange. This means that users will need to be signed into an\nSFU's Approved Email Application\nin order to send to an Exchange Distribution Group with Restricted Senders.\nNesting Permission\n: To add another Group as a member of your Group,\nyou are required to have Manager or Readers privileges on the Group before you're able to add it as a member to your own Group.\nNo self-subscribe or unsubscribe\n: You will need to move to and use SimpleList\nif you require this feature.\nNo external users\n: You will need to move to and use SimpleList if you require sending emails to external (non-SFU) email addresses.\nTo see the full list of changes, visit\nDifferences between SFU Groups and SFU Maillist\n.\nNote\n: These are functional differences between SFU Maillist and SFU Groups. For impacts or changes to your maillist resulting from migration, see\nWhat actions do I need to take?\n.\nSECURITY MAILLISTS\nMAILLIST PURPOSE\nMIGRATED TO\nLists used for security only\nGroup Management (SFU Groups)\nManaged at\ngroups.sfu.ca\n(or\ngrouper.its.sfu.ca\nfor technical staff)\nVisit this page to learn how to request a new Security Group\nLists used for both security and email distribution\nGroup Management (SFU Groups)\nWill be split into\ntwo separate groups\n: one for security and one for emailing\nManaged at\ngroups.sfu.ca\n(or\ngrouper.its.sfu.ca\nfor technical staff)\nWant to know how SFU Maillist compares to SFU Groups?\nSee\nDifferences between SFU Groups and SFU Maillist\n.\nWHAT ACTIONS DO I NEED TO TAKE?\nMIGRATING ANY REMAINING MAILLISTS\nBefore SFU Maillist is retired on April 30, 2025, we recommend checking if you have any remaining maillists that need to be migrated.\nFor maillist managers\nand owners:\nVisit maillist.sfu.ca >\nFind maillists owned/managed by me\nOn another browser tab or window, visit groups.sfu.ca >\nManage your Groups\nCompare the two list of maillists/groups and ask yourself: Are the maillists that are important to me have already migrated to SFU Groups?\nIf you discover that some maillists have\nnot\nbeen migrated, please take the following action before April 30, 2025.\nIf the maillist is used for emailing\n:\nRequest a new\nExchange Distribution Group on SFU Groups\nas a replacement, or\nRequest a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\nif you wish to migrate the existing maillist.\nIf the maillist is used for security (access to an application, service or resource)\n:\nContact your departmental IT staff for assistance. The process will vary depending on the application, service or resource.\nMAILLIST FOR EMAIL DISTRIBUTION\nFrom December 2024 to April 2025,\nActive maillists\nwill be automatically migrated to\nSFU Groups as Exchange Distribution Groups\nand prior to migration will be shown in the\nActive Maillist Migration List\nfor visibility purposes. You can only see maillists that you own. Technical staff members will have additional features and visibility for troubleshooting purposes.\nMaillist names and email addresses will remain the same if migrated in this manner. Once a maillist is migrated, it will become read-only on\nmaillist.sfu.ca\n. To manage your groups, you'll need to use\ngroups.sfu.ca\n.\nFor maillist managers\nand owners:\nView the list of maillists planned for migration shown in the\nActive Maillist Migration List\nto ensure its accuracy.\nIf you need to transfer ownership of a maillist (i.e., it's owned by someone who is no longer at the university or expired sponsored account), request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nYou will be notified by email two weeks prior to the migration.\nWe\nstrongly recommend\ngoing through the questions below if they are related to your work.\nWHAT IS AN ACTIVE MAILLIST?\nOnly active maillists will be automatically migrated. This means that if the maillist was used for\nemail delivery since July 2022\n, it is considered active and will be migrated for email distribution to Exchange Distribution Groups on SFU Groups.\nIf you own active maillists, they should appear on the\nActive Maillist Migration List\nwhich means that they'll be automatically migrated to SFU Groups as Exchange Distribution Groups.\nNote\n: Maillists that are only used for security won't appear on the\nActive Maillist Migration List\nsince they're not used for email delivery. See\nMaillist for Security\nbelow.\nCan I migrate an inactive maillist?\nYes, any maillist that hasn't been used for email delivery since July 2022 can still be migrated for the purposes of email distribution. Simply send an email to the maillist and it will appear in the\nActive Maillist Migration List\nthe following day.\nFor assistance, request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO NESTED MAILLISTS?\nMaillist nesting refers to adding a maillist as a recipient (or member) of another maillist.\nSince the permissions model is different in SFU Groups, if you are an owner of a maillist with a nested maillist, you will now require Reader or Manager privileges to that nested maillist when maillists are migrated over as Exchange Distribution Groups.\nExample:\ndept-managers-all\nunit-a-managers (nested maillist)\nunit-b-managers (nested maillist)\njane_doe@sfu.ca (owner)\njohn_doe@sfu.ca (member)\nIn this example, Jane Doe is an owner of\ndept\n-managers-all\n.\nJane Doe now requires Reader or Manager privileges for\nunit-a-managers\nand\nunit-b-managers\nin SFU Groups.\nWHAT DO I NEED TO DO - NESTED MAILLIST WITHIN DEPARTMENT\nIf you also happen to be the owner of that nested maillist, you don't need to take additional action. If the nested maillist is not owned or managed by you, you should get manager role for that maillist prior to migration for a seamless transition to SFU Groups.\nBe sure to check on the\nActive Maillist Migration List\nto see if you have any maillists that have \"nested non-owned lists\". Contact the maillist owners of those \"nested non-owned lists\" for manager role to those nested maillists.\nWHAT DO I NEED TO DO - NESTED MAILLIST CROSS DEPARTMENT\nIf the nested maillist is owned by someone from another department, you should get manager role for that maillist prior to migration for a seamless transition to SFU Groups.\nBe sure to check on the\nActive Maillist Migration List\nto see if you have any maillists that have \"nested non-owned lists\". Contact the maillist owners of those \"nested non-owned lists\" for manager role to those nested maillists.\nNested maillist from another department where they haven't been migrated yet:\nYour nested maillist will be\nautomatically removed\nfrom the membership list.\nOnce removed from the membership list, you will need to wait until the other department has also migrated. If you followed the steps above prior to migration, you should have manager role to the remove nested maillist. Simply re-add the nested maillist on SFU Groups.\nNested maillist from another department where they already migrated:\nIf you followed the steps above prior to migration, you should have the correct privileges to the nested maillist on SFU Groups. You don't need to take additional action.\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MAILLIST WITH RESTRICTED SENDERS?\nThis refers to maillists that has the setting, \"Restrict Sender\" or \"Allow list\", enabled.\nAfter migrating these maillists to Exchange Distribution Groups, this setting will be turned off by default\nand\nallowing any SFU member to send email to the group.\nIf you wish to restrict sending ability to specific individuals or groups, you will need to apply this setting on SFU Groups.\nNote the additional security requirements: Users will need to be signed into an\nSFU's Approved Email Application\nin order to send emails to an Exchange Distribution Group with Restricted Senders. This can have technical implications to automated emailing systems.\nFor technical details, see\nDifferences between SFU Groups and SFU Maillist\n.\nNote\n: Only course/plan groups are exceptions to this and will have their Restricted Sender setting migrated.\nWhat will happen to course or academic plan lists?\nCourse and academic plan lists will be migrated along with its department. This will happen between January to April 2025.\nwhat will happen to maillists with external recipients?\nSFU Maillist can no longer send email to external addresses since Summer 2024.\nIf you own an active maillist that contain external recipients, it will still be automatically migrated to SFU Groups and shown in the\nActive Maillist Migration List\n. However, any\nexternal recipients on maillists will be automatically removed upon migration\nto SFU Groups.\nTo continue sending emails to external users, switch to\nSimpleList\nor\nCampaigner\n. Alternatively, you can 'cc' any external recipients when using Exchange Distribution Group (SFU Groups).\nSimpleLists\ndoes support importing membership to make setup a bit easier. If migrated to SimpleLists, maillist names and email addresses will be different where\n@sfu.ca will become @lists.sfu.ca\n.\nCampaigner\nfacilitates various marketing features and allows for one-way messaging only: from you to the members. For maillists that are used for email campaigning, you may want to migrate to Campaigner.\nWhat accounts are not migrated to SFU Groups?\nThe following will be removed from your membership list when migrated to SFU Groups:\nExternal emails\nExpired, inactive or destroyed SFU accounts (e.g., expired sponsored accounts, accounts of those who no longer at the university)\nNested maillists from another department (only in cases where that department hasn't been migrated yet, and your department is/being migrated)\nWill owner and manager role be migrated?\nYes, user privileges will be migrated. However, since SFU Groups doesn't have the concept of ownership, owners will be given manager privileges. This is by design to ensure ownership doesn't become stale.\nMAILLIST FOR SECURITY\nFor maillist managers and owners:\nIf your maillist is only for security purposes (or access control), you will be notified per service basis for next steps. You may be asked to request a security (reference) group from\nyour departmental IT staff\n. Instructions will be provided when you notified about the service migration to SFU Groups.\nIf you are a service or product owner, where you have integrated maillists into your business processes and technology that IT Services does not manage, you may either need to coordinate with your departmental IT staff to set up your list on Grouper (in which it will be available to you to manage at\ngroups.sfu.ca\n) or migrate the list yourself onto\nGrouper if you are an IT staff\nbefore early 2025.\nWhat is a security list?\nSecurity lists (or access control lists) refers to maillists that are used for security or access control to services or resources.\nFor example, you may have used a maillist to control which members (SFU accounts) have access to a departmental team on Microsoft Teams, access to an AEM website, or access to a shared folder on SFU Vault.\nHow do I know if my maillist is used for security?\nUnfortunately, there is no definitive way to know if you maillist is currently being used by a service for security purposes or access controls.\nThere may be some hints or indications based on the maillist name, description, or working knowledge from staff members.\nWhat happens if I can't Migrate my security lists before Maillist retirement?\nTo ensure a smooth transition, your security maillists will continue to work normally. However, maillists will become read-only and you will no longer be able to edit the membership list.\nWe encourage you to migrate your security maillists to SFU Groups to ensure uninterrupted edit access to your security membership groups.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor questions about Group Management or SFU Maillist Retirement, request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nRelated Articles (1)\nService Migrations to SFU Groups (Grouper)\nSFU Maillist to SFU Groups migration tracking.\nRelated Services / Offerings (2)\nGroup Management\nGroup Management simplifies access management by letting you use the same group or role across many services at SFU.\nMaillists\nSFU Maillist is a web application designed to simplify the management of SFU email addresses. For email lists with External address, use SimpleLists or Campaigner",

    "clean_body_text": "OVERVIEW\nMicrosoft will be retiring SharePoint 2019 and ending all support in July 2026. To reduce security risks, and protect academic, research, and business data, site owners are advised to migrate their active content out of\nsharepoint.sfu.ca\nas soon as possible.\nFor more SharePoint Online resources:\nSharePoint Online - How-To Guides\nSharePoint Online - FAQs\nThis article contains information on the following:\nWhat Should I Know?\nWhat are my Options?\nHow to Migrate?\nOption 1: IT Services Migration\nOption 2: Self-Migration\nSite Audit\nStep 1: Check Your Inventory\nStep 2: Review and Cleanup\nStep 3: Take Notes on Access Permissions\nStep 4: Specify How You Want to Move Your Content\nStep 5: You're Ready to Submit a Request\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW?\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO MY SHAREPOINT SITE?\nAs support for SharePoint 2019 will soon cease, you will need to migrate the active contents of your current site. Depending on your needs, your site will most likely migrate to either Microsoft Teams or SharePoint Online, with the support of IT Services. However, you may also choose to migrate your content somewhere else. See\nWhat Are My Options?\nfor details.\nWHEN TO MIGRATE?\nSharePoint 2019 will be retired by July 2026 and replaced by Microsoft Teams and SharePoint Online. However, as Microsoft's support will cease, we encourage site owners to start the migration process as soon as possible. A few things to consider:\nTiming\n: The duration of the migration process will vary depending on the size and complexity of your site. Consider the best time of year for your unit to make this transition.\nDelays\n: If IT Services is migrating your content to Microsoft Teams or SharePoint Online, there could be delays depending on the number of migration requests we are supporting at that time.\nImprovements\n: If you migrate to Microsoft Teams or SharePoint Online, you may discover that these have far better usability and features than the current SharePoint 2019 – worth moving sooner rather than later!\nNEXT STEPS\nBetween November 2024 and January 2025, site owners will receive an email from the SharePoint team (IT Services). Site owners are asked to audit their site collections to identify active content for migration, transfer university records to the Archives and Records Management team and delete outdated content. An inventory spreadsheet will be provided for owners to assist with the audit and migration.\nWe encourage site owners should migrate active content to another tool when available. There are two options to migrate:\nOption 1: IT Services Migration\n- IT Services can migrate their site content to Microsoft Teams or SharePoint Online after a\nsite audit\nhas been completed by the site owner.\nOption 2:\nSelf-migration\n- Site owners will migrate their site content themselves.\nSee\nWhat Are My Options?\nfor details on what's best for you.\nWHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?\nSite owners will have two options to migrate their site content.\nOption 1: IT Services Migration\nOption 2: Self-migration\nIT Services can migrate their site content to Microsoft Teams or SharePoint Online after a site audit has been completed by the site owner.\nIdeal for\n:\nSites that have a lot of content\nYou wish to migrate to either Microsoft Teams or SharePoint Online\nSite owners will migrate their site content themselves.\nIdeal for\n:\nSites that have little content (where you can individually download or copy all your content to another space)\nYou wish to migrate to somewhere else that is not Microsoft Teams or SharePoint Online\nReady for next steps?\nOnce you've determined what option you want to take, see\nHow to Migrate?\nfor details.\nUNSURE WHERE TO MIGRATE?\nAs part of the migration process, Site Owners will need to choose which tool to migrate their site content to. For some guidance:\nIf you're considering SharePoint Online, be sure to check if SharePoint Online is still the right tool for you:\nHow SharePoint sites are used at SFU - Supported and Unsupported Use-cases\nIf you're considering another tool, be sure to check if that tool is right for you:\nChoosing a Document and Content Management Tool at SFU - Comparison Chart\nFor technical information on SharePoint Online:\nDifferences between SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint Online\nHOW TO MIGRATE?\nTo migrate your site using\nIT Services Migration (Option 1)\n:\nBetween\nNovember 2024 and January 2025\n, site owners have received an\nemail from the SharePoint team (IT Services)\nwith an\nattached\nContent Inventory Spreadsheet\n.\nSite owners will be asked to complete a\nSite Audit\n(\ndetails outlined below\n)\n.\nAfter completing the\nSite Audit\n, submit a request to\nSharePoint 2019 Migration Request Form\nand attach the\ncompleted Content Inventory Spreadsheet\n.\nYou will be reached out to have a short consultation with IT Services to finalize the\nContent Inventory Spreadsheet\n. IT Services will begin migrating content to the specified locations.\nAn email notification will be sent when the migration is finished. You will be asked to verify its completeness at the new location.\nAny items or settings that aren't migrated will need to be manually replicated by site owners:\nSite access permissions\nFile or folder shared permissions\nWorkflows\nOneNote items\nSome page webparts, layouts and styling\nPages, including Wiki pages\nThe following aspects of Lists:\nAttachments\nViews using Javascript and webparts\nThe following metadata:\nContent types\nAuthor/Modified by for users that no longer exist\nPicture and video metadata from asset and classic media libraries\nAfter migration is verified by site owners, your SharePoint 2019 site collection will be deleted.\nNOTES\nRequests are processed on a first come, first served basis. Times will vary based on the number of active requests.\nSome SharePoint 2019 functionality might not have an equivalent in Microsoft 365. Visit\nDifferences between SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint Online\nfor details.\nIT Services will inform site owners which content cannot be migrated and will have to be manually built by them.\nContent migration into a location outside of Microsoft 365 needs to be completed by the site owner.\nTo migrate your site using\nSelf-Migration (Option 2)\n:\nBetween\nNovember 2024 and January 2025\n, site owners will receive an\nemail from the SharePoint team (IT Services)\nwith an\nattached\nContent Inventory Spreadsheet\n.\nIt's recommended that Site Owners complete a review and cleanup of their site content (\nStep 2 of the Site Audit\n) prior to migration.\nSite Owners migrate their active content the tool or service of their choice. Visit our self-migration resources for instructions on downloading your site content:\nSharePoint 2019 - Self Migration Guide on Files & Documents\nSharePoint 2019 - Self Migration Guide on Lists\nIf you have questions, you can submit a request ticket at\n.\nWhen you've completed the self-migration of all your content on the\nContent Inventory Spreadsheet\n, reply to the email to let us know. Your SharePoint 2019 site collection will be deleted once we have confirmation.\nNOTES\nBe sure to know the limitations of self-migration. This includes there having\nno way to download multiple files at once\nfrom SharePoint 2019. If you are considering self-migration options, you will have to download your files manually one-by-one.\nFor more Known Limitations, visit\nSharePoint 2019 - Self Migration Guide on Files & Documents\nand\nSharePoint 2019 - Self Migration Guide on Lists\n.\nSITE AUDIT\nCompleting a\nSite Audit\nis required as part of\nStep 2\non \"How to Migrate?\"\n. This is to clean up any inactive content and prepare for the migration.\nEach site owner will receive a site\nContent Inventory Spreadsheet\nwhen you receive an email notification to move out of SharePoint 2019. Use this site spreadsheet to complete your\nSite Audit\nby completing the following steps:\nSTEP 1: CHECK YOUR INVENTORY\nOpen the\nContent Inventory Spreadsheet\nto see what should be moved out of SharePoint 2019. Review to ensure what's listed is correct to your knowledge.\nThe spreadsheet contains the list of site pages, document libraries, forms and more that you own on SharePoint 2019 (referred to as containers for your site collection, which also includes any subsites and its containers).\nNote\n: Any containers on your site that are empty (e.g., have no content and items) will\nnot\nbe included in the Content Inventory Spreadsheet.\nSTEP 2: REVIEW AND CLEAN UP\nVisit your sites, subsites and containers (document libraries, lists, forms, etc.) to review and cleanup your content. Sift through your documents, files and content to determine if they should be\nmigrated\n,\narchived\nor\ndestroyed\n.\nStandard practice to determine if content should be\nmigrated\n,\narchived\nor\ndestroyed\ngoes as follows:\nIdentify Inactive Content\n: Any content that is past its\nretention schedule\n(as defined by SFU Archives and Records Management) can be inactive content. This can vary greatly depending on the contents of your site.\nArchive or Destroy Inactive Content\n:\nFollow the content's retention and filing guidelines on its\nretention schedule\nto either archive or destroy the inactive content.\nIf you need to\narchive the inactive content\n(as specified by the guidelines to be kept as a university record), the content should be\ntransferred to SFU Archives and Records Management\n.\nIf you need to\ndestroy the inactive content\n, follow the the guidelines on how to destroy, which\ntypically involve\ndeleting the content or move the content to your personal space.\nMigrate\nany remaining items or content (\nactive content\n) to a new or different work space.\nTIP\nTo find relevant\nretention schedules\nto you, consider sorting\nBy Department\nand selecting\nShow All\nwhen browsing the list of retention schedules. Additionally, here are some quick links to\ncommon\nretention schedules\nthat can be applicable to all departments:\nTransitory Records\nTransitory Records\n- Documents of short-term usefulness, created to serve a temporary purpose and/or in the preparation of a final, official record.\nGeneral Administrative, Program and Subject Files\nGeneral Administrative, Program and Subject Files\n- Records may include correspondence and memoranda, statistics, reports and working papers, forms, mailing lists, policies and procedures, budgets, financial reports and transaction records, work orders, manuals, proposals, brochures and publications. Academic departments have similar functions and therefore their general office files are similar.\nCommittee Files\nCommittee Files\n- This schedule applies to records made or received and used to support the deliberations, decisions and activities of all committees formed by university-wide bodies. Records may include agendas, minutes, memoranda, correspondence, policies and procedures, support documentation, studies, reports, statistics and working papers.\nOnce you have found a retention schedule that is relevant, select and expand \"\nRetention and Filing Guidelines\n\" for details on how and when to archive or destroy your content.\nFor more tips, visit\nRRSDA Search Tips\n.\nSTEP 3: TAKE NOTES ON ACCESS PERMISSIONS\nTake notes on access permissions to your site collection. This includes:\nAccess permissions to your site, subsites, containers (document libraries, list, forms, pages, etc.)\nIndividual file or folder sharing in the document library\nYou will need to replicate it in the new location since access/shared permissions are not migrated.\nSTEP 4: SPECIFY HOW YOU WANT TO MOVE YOUR CONTENT\nNOTES\nIf you use Subsites in SharePoint 2019, this feature has been deprecated. This is because Microsoft 365 has a flat site structure.\nReminder that SharePoint is intended to be used only with SFU users. If you require sharing access with a non-SFU user, consider switching to Microsoft Teams or\nanother tool\n.\nImportant considerations:\nEnsure that your destination SharePoint Online site has enough free storage to accommodate the migrated content (storage size limit is 100GB)\nGo to: Site settings > Storage Metrics\nDocuments or List items shouldn’t be migrated to existing destination Document Libraries or Lists if the site columns are different\nThe URL limit of 400 characters should be considered when deciding on the file name length and folder path depth\nMOVING TO TEAMS?\nMoving your content to Microsoft Teams will require you to have a team. If you wish to create a new team, visit the\nRequest a new Team\n.\nOpen the\nContent Inventory Spreadsheet\n.\nThere will be two blank columns:\nMigrate (Y/N)\nand\nTarget URL\n. Complete the spreadsheet by specifying on each container of your site collection (rows in the sheet) if it should be migrated and its target URL.\nFor Target URLs, you can choose your root site (to migrate the entire container with its content) or an existing library/folder (to migrate all content from the container).\nSave the\nContent Inventory Spreadsheet\n. This will be attached to your submission when requesting a migration in\nStep 3 of \"How to Migrate?\"\n.\nExample of a completed Content Inventory Spreadsheet indicated by the two 'filled' last columns:\nSite Title\nSite URL\nItem Count\nLast Modified\nList URL\nList-Library\nCreated By\nMigrate (Y/N)\nTarget URL\nInitiatives\nhttps://sharep...\n51\n3/3/2024\nhttps://sharep.../Shared Doc...\nDocuments\nDemo\nY\nhttps://1sfu.sharepoint.com/teams/...\nInitiatives\nhttps://sharep...\n4\n2/26/2024\nhttps://sharep.../Pages/...\nPages\nDemo\nY\nhttps://1sfu.sharepoint.com/teams/...\nInitiatives\nhttps://sharep...\n1\n2/26/2024\nhttps://sharep.../Lists/...\nStakeholder\nDemo\nN\nBlue\nhttps://sharep.../Blue\n4\n2/26/2024\nhttps://sharep.../Blue/Shared Doc...\nDocuments\nDemo\nY\nhttps://1sfu.sharepoint.com/teams/.../Blue-Old\nSTEP 5: YOU'RE READY TO SUBMIT A REQUEST\nCongratulations! You've finished the\nSite Audit\nand completed the\nContent Inventory Spreadsheet\n. You are now ready to move onto\nStep 3 of \"How to Migrate?\"\nwhere the site owner sends a request to\nSharePoint 2019 Migration Request Form\n, attaching the completed content inventory spreadsheet.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor questions or assistance with SharePoint 2019 migration, site owners can request a support ticket using\nSharePoint - Ask a Question\n.",

    "clean_body_text": "Teaching and Learning\nPolling and Surveys\nOVERVIEW\nBelow are common questions about Simply Voting: a voting service that allows SFU units to conduct secure elections.\nFAQ\nHow do I find out more information about simply voting?\nSee the\nVoting and Elections service page\nabout Simply Voting at SFU. The vendor also has support and information on their homepage:\nhttps://simplyvoting.com\nDoes sfu have an enterprise license for simply voting?\nYes, SFU has an account with Simply Voting. Any email address (SFU or non-SFU) can participate in an election, but if you wish to host an election, then you must be an SFU account holder supporting teaching, learning, research, or administration at the university and request an account from the\nVoting and Elections service page\n.\nWhen should I use survey monkey or simply voting?\nSurvey Monkey\nis the recommended web survey tool that is in use across the university. It offers extensive features including customizable surveys, secure data handling, and efficient data analysis tool. Simply Voting is the recommended voting tool that meets SFU’s security functionality standards. This service is provided to support voting for university-related teaching, learning, research, and administrative purposes.\nhow do i create or participate in an election in simply voting?\nTo participate in an election, you can simply click on the link that was emailed directly to you, or you can visit\nhttps://sfu.simplyvoting.com\nand log in using your SFU Computing ID and password. You’ll be able to view all the elections you’re allowed to vote in if you’ve been added to a vote using your SFU Computing ID.\nTo hold an election, you will need to create an account from the\nVoting and Elections service page\nwith your SFU ID to become an election manager. If you have already requested an account to be an election manager, to manage your elections you must visit:\nhttps://simplyvoting.com\nEnter \"sfu\" as the \"Voting Website\" and click the login button. This will then log you in via SFU CAS. Once logged in, you will see your Simply Voting dashboard where you can create or manage elections\nIf you want to hold an election with both SFU and non-SFU users, you will need to use the\nvote segmentation tool\n. You can add voters for whom you have SFU Computing IDs into one segment and send them an invitation to log in using SFU CAS, and other users for whom you only have an email address can be put in a separate segment and sent a different email invitation that gives them a unique, one-time link to vote. It's best to send separate messages to each segment with instructions tailored for that group: for example, send a message to the SFU Computing ID group that simply points them to https://sfu.simplyvoting.com to log in, where they will see their eligible elections displayed on the dashboard; for the other segment with only email addresses, send them an email with the custom voting link. There are many ways to handle this situation, including the approach of sending all voters a unique link instead of requiring SFU CAS login: we'd suggest using CAS whenever possible and for highly sensitive votes where the strongest possible auditing is needed.\nFor any other questions or support, you can visit\nSimply Voting’s support page\n.\nHow do I add voters if I want them to log in using SFU CAS?\nIn order to require people to log in via SFU CAS, you must upload your voters' list with the Elector ID field containing the SFU Computing ID. The SFU Computing ID is the identifier that you usually use to log in to campus system without @sfu.ca appended. For example, \"kipling\" is the SFU Computing ID, not \"kipling@sfu.ca\" or other email address variants like \"rudyard_kipling@sfu.ca\"\nWhen you use this method, you can use the default email template to send out messages that will include only the voting website URL: https://sfu.simplyvoting.com . When a person visits that address, they will be asked to log in with SFU CAS and be presented with a dashboard showing them the elections for which they are eligible to vote. The default \"Email Blast\" template includes the SFU site URL via the {{voting_website_link}} placeholder, so the default email template can be used.\nI don't have a list of SFU Computing IDs, but I do have email addresses, how do I add voters?\nWhen you upload your voters list from a CSV file, you can use email addresses for both the \"Elector ID\" and the \"Email\" fields. In this scenario, people will not use SFU CAS to login but will instead get a unique link sent to allow a single vote to be made from each email address.\nWhen you use this method, you will need to modify the default \"Email Blast Template\" to replace {{voting_website_link}} with {{direct_vote_link}}. {{direct_vote_link}} will be replaced in the email body with a unique, one-time voting link for the recipient of the email.\n.\n\"VOTER ID\" AND CAS LOGIN\nThere are two ways that people can be given access to an election as a elector/voter in Simply Voting:\nLogging in with their SFU Computing ID via SFU CAS, or\nEmail invitation, if you don't have SFU Computing IDs.\nBoth methods offer anonymity and one-vote-per elector, but using SFU CAS is the preferred method for critical votes and elections. In order to use SFU CAS, your voters' list must be uploaded to Simply Voting using the electors' SFU Computing IDs. The SFU Computing ID is the 8-character-or-less ID that an individual typically types into systems to log in (eg. Rudyard Kipling may have an email address of rudyard_kipling@sfu.ca, but log in as \"kipling\" into SFU systems. The \"kipling\" variant is what is needed for the Simply Voting voters' list in order to enable log in using SFU CAS). If you have lists of voters in a tool such as SFU Maillist or SFU Groups, you can download the SFU Computing ID from those lists/groups, but you may need to remove the \"@sfu.ca\" suffix from each entry in order to get the format needed for Simply Voting -- eg. \"kipling@sfu.ca\" downloaded from one of those tools becomes \"kipling\")\nNote: Voter ID should be the SFU Computing ID (eg. \"kipling\"), not a staff/student ID number (eg. \"30005555\"). Computing IDs can be found in various administrative systems such as MyINFO for staff, or can be downloaded from SFU Maillist or SFU Groups if you have the target membership in an existing list or group. If you do *not* have a complete list of SFU Computing IDs for your electors/voters, you can alternatively use email addresses and have the system send out unique, one-time voting links to each email address on your voting list. Both methods restrict votes to one per voter appropriately. If you use the approach where you have access to SFU Computing IDs you can ensure that voters are validated by SFU's CAS sign-on method, which provides an extra layer of security by requiring that the voter is authenticated directly at the time of voting.",

All responsible individuals will receive an email from IT Services to complete group reviews.\nHOW OFTEN?\nGroup Reviews happen\nevery 100 days\nto follow a semester (once per term/semester). When a group is marked for reviewing, you will have additional time for a reviewer to certify its membership. Once a group has completed its review, the 100 day duration will reset.\nIf you happen to manage many groups, you may receive multiple \"group review\" emails throughout the week. Reminder emails will be send prior to the due date. If action hasn't been taken, additional reminder emails will be sent bi-weekly on the same group thereafter.\nEDITING ATTESTATION NOTIFICATION SETTINGS\nAttestation settings can only be modified by Grouper IT Admins. The only legitimate purposes to edit these settings are: changing who receives reminder emails to complete group reviews, or reducing the number of days to re-attest (more frequent).\nReach out to your\nGrouper IT Admin\nif you need to edit these settings.\nHOW TO REVIEW\nSTEP 1\nWait for your email notification. Group Managers will receive an email notification when your group is due for a review.\nSTEP 2\nVisit SFU Groups or\ngroups.sfu.ca\n. You should see a banner that lists which groups require reviewing.\nSelect\none of the listed group to review it\n. You can visit the group directly from the email notification.\nSTEP 3\nReview your\nGroup Members\nto ensure that it is accurate and up to date. Adjust your membership as needed.

Where should I start with Group Management?\nWe recommend reading the\nIntroduction to Group Management and Comparison Chart\nfor a better understanding on how groups are used at SFU. If you wish to explore options for emailing services at SFU, visit\nEmail Distribution Lists\n.\nWhat are the different group types?\nIn SFU Groups,\ngroups\nare used to organize users who have similar roles or responsibilities. Think of a group as a team or a club: when you add users to a group, you can manage their access to resources and privileges all at once, instead of doing it individually for each user. There are two types SFU Groups:\nExchange Distribution Group\n:\nExchange Distribution Groups\n(EDGs, or distribution groups) is a feature of\nMicrosoft Exchange (SFU's email system)\nthat allows a user to send messages to a list of SFU email addresses, or to members of other SFU Groups, all at once. For more details, visit\nRequst a Group (Exchange Distribution)\n.\nSecurity Group\n:\nSecurity groups (or reference groups) are used for security or access control to services or resources. Security groups contain a list of SFU members and can be synced to multiple services or resources to provide access, assign privileges or provision licensing. For more information, visit\nRequest a Security Group (Reference Group)\n.\nWhat is Direct and Indirect membership type?\nWhile viewing groups in SFU Groups, you may see that members are listed as direct or indirect members.\nDirect Member\n:\nIf you add an individual or another group as a member to your group, the individual/group is classified as a direct member to your group.\nIndirect Member\n:\nAdding another group (a \"nested\" or \"child\" group) to your group will automatically populate all the individuals from the \"nested/child\" group. These individuals will appear on your group membership and are classified as indirect members to your group.\nEXCHANGE DISTRIBUTION GROUPS\nWhat is an exchange distribution group?\nExchange Distribution Groups\n(EDGs, or distribution groups) is a feature of\nMicrosoft Exchange (SFU's email system)\nthat allows a user to send messages to a list of SFU email addresses, or to members of other SFU Groups, all at once. For more details, visit\nRequest a Group (Exchange Distribution)\n.\nHow do I add or remove managers on Exchange Distribution groups?\nIf you are a manager of a group, you can add or remove other managers by\nadding or removing members on the 'group managers' privilege tab\n.\nCan I set a Manager to not receive email?\nYes. As long as a\ngroup manager\nis also not a\ngroup member\n, they will not receive emails on the distribution group.\nCan I set my Exchange Distribution Group to receive email outside of SFU?\nYes. You can adjust this under\nEdit Distribution Group Settings\nand set it to be a\nPublic group\n.\nNote\n: Know that this also increases the likelihood to receive spam emails.\nCan I add a security group (Reference Group) as a member of my Exchange Distribution Group?\nYes. This is ideal for very large or complicated distribution groups. Such groups may benefit from having\nautomated memberships or auto-populated groups\n.\nCan I use an Exchange Distribution Group with SimpleList?\nTechnically, yes, as long as you have enabled the group to be public. You can adjust this under\nEdit Distribution Group Settings\nand set it to be a\nPublic group\n.\nNote\n: Know that there isn’t no self-unsubscribe for Exchange Distribution Groups.\nCan I use an Exchange Distribution Group with Campaigner?\nTechnically, yes, as long as you have enabled the group to be public. You can adjust this under\nEdit Distribution Group Settings\nand set it to be a\nPublic group\n.\nNote\n: Know that if someone from the distribution group clicks \"unsubscribe\" on the Campaigner email, the entire distribution group will be unsubscribed.\nHow do I rename my Exchange Distribution Group?\nUnfortunately, there is no easy way to rename Exchange Distribution Groups once it has been created. We recommend simply requesting a new Exchange Distribution Group with the corrected name.\nIn rare cases where you need to have an existing Exchange Distribution Group renamed, request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nHow do I delete my Exchange Distribution Group?\nAny deletion requests for Exchange Distribution Groups will need to be done by our Identity team. Request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nSECURITY GROUPS\nWhat is a security group?\nSecurity groups (or reference groups) are used for security or access control to services or resources. Security groups contain a list of SFU members and can be synced to multiple services or resources to provide access, assign privileges or provision licensing. For more information, visit\nRequest a Security Group (Reference Group)\n.\nHow do I add or remove managers on Security groups?\nOnly Grouper IT admins can add or remove managers on security groups.\nContact your department's IT staff (or the individual who has originally created the group on your behalf) to make the adjustments. If you are unsure, request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nWhat are Group Reviews and why am I getting emails?\nA\ngroup review (or attestation)\nrefers to the periodic review to certify that their membership is accurate and up-to-date, and that the group is still required or in-use on SFU Groups.\nTo ensure that security groups don't become stale, group reviews happen every 100 days to follow a semester (once per term/semester) and email notifications are sent to group managers to review and certify their groups are accurate and are still in-use.\nIf you happen to manage many groups, you may receive multiple \"group review\" emails throughout the week.\nIf you are no longer supposed to be a manager of the group, or the group is no longer needed, contact your department's IT staff (or the individual who has originally created the group on your behalf) to make any modifications your security group. If you are unsure, request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nHow do I rename my Security Group?\nUnfortunately, renaming security groups after it has been created can sever its connection with other SFU systems and cause additional problems. We recommend against renaming security groups unless there's a clear reason to do so.\nIn rare cases where you need to have a security group renamed, contact your department's IT staff (or the individual who has originally created the group on your behalf) to rename your security group. If you are unsure, request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nHow do I delete my Security Group?\nContact your department's IT staff (or the individual who has originally created the group on your behalf) to delete your security group. If you are unsure, request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\nWhy am I not receiving emails from an Exchange Distribution Group?\nThe two common reasons for not receiving emails from an Exchange Distribution Group:\nDouble-check that you are a member of the group.\nGroup Managers wanting to receive email need to also be included as a member.\nYou sent your email too quickly before membership changes have been synced.\nIf you recently made changes to your group membership, you will need to wait an additional 30 minutes for the changes to fully sync to Microsoft servers.\nWhy do I see \"Entity not found\" in the membership of my group?\nThis is because someone (usually another manager) has added another group as a member to your group. Because you don't have view permissions to the added group, it appears as \"entity not found\" on your side.\nWhy aren't changes applied to my security group or distribution group?\nIf you are making changes to Exchange Distribution Groups or security groups linked to a Microsoft service (e.g., Teams, SharePoint), you will need to wait an additional 30 minutes for your changes to fully sync to Microsoft servers.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor additional assistance, request a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nRelated Articles (1)\nService Migrations to SFU Groups (Grouper)\nSFU Maillist to SFU Groups migration tracking.\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nEmail Distribution Lists\nTools that provides the ability to send email messages to multiple email addresses using a list or a group.",

    "clean_body_text": "OVERVIEW\nThis article outlines sensitivity labels and how they are applied in Microsoft 365 at SFU.\nWhat are Sensitivity Labels?\nSensitivity Label Classifications\nWhat to expect when Sensitivity Labels are applied to data?\nWhat are Sensitivity Labels?\nA sensitivity label is a way to classify documents and content to protect it. By applying a sensitivity label, a document gains additional security features that help you securely work and collaborate with sensitive or confidential data at SFU. For example, an email containing personal information may use a confidential label that prevents recipients from forwarding the email, printing it, or copy-pasting text from it.\nSensitivity labels at the university follow\nSFU's data security standard\nto help you safeguard content that may have confidential information.\nHow to use sensitivity labels?\nSensitivity labels can be applied to files, emails, meetings and more. There are also several convenient ways to use them in Microsoft 365 apps (such as Word, Excel, Outlook...etc) so you can add them based on what you're working on.\nFor online resources, explore the\nsupport.microsoft.com\nwebsite or see the overview articles below.\nApply sensitivity labels to your files and email\nApply sensitivity labels to email messages in Outlook\nSensitivity Label Classifications\nIndividual Data\nPublic Data\nInternal Data\nRegulated Data (Confidential)\nINDIVIDUAL DATA\nDescription\nIndividual Data is non-SFU related data.

Cyber attacks and phishing attempts are on the rise and continue to get more sophisticated. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a proactive security solution that protects against malicious activity before it can create a problem to the end user. EDR software runs in the background of your managed device and if/when malicious activity is identified, you will receive a pop-up notice.\nDETAILS\nSFU is committed to protecting the digital information and systems that are critical to teaching, research and university operations.\nCyber-attacks and phishing attempts are on the rise and continue to get more sophisticated. IT Services strives to protect and mitigate cybersecurity risks for SFU.\nEDR FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nWhat is endpoint detection & response?\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a proactive security solution that protects against malicious activity before it can create a problem to the end user. To recognize and respond to potential threats and to protect the SFU community’s information and data, Information Security Services and IT Services are creating a more secure digital space and will continue to execute projects like EDR from the latest security plan.\nWhy is EDR being implemented?\nEDR, along with other information security initiatives such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and regularly resetting our passwords, are proactive ways we can enhance our ability to counter cyber-attacks and better protect the SFU community.\nIS EDR Monitoring my files or webpages I visit?\nNo. EDR software monitors malicious application activity and doesn’t monitor individual use or their files. It is NOT monitoring and reporting individuals’ activities on the web nor processing or indexing their files or other information on their computers. The new EDR program monitors what applications are doing on your computer – not you.\nHow does it Impact Managed Devices?\nUsers don’t need to do anything and won’t notice any differences on their managed devices unless there’s a malicious attack on their computer. EDR software runs in the background of your managed device and if/when malicious activity is identified, you will receive a pop-up notice. Users with EDR installed may also notice a new green circle icon in the menu on your device.\nHow edr can help mitigate effects of a ransomware attack?\nEDR works at the kernel level, to evaluate and prevent activity that the operating system simply shouldn’t be doing. As compared to anti-virus software which uses canned heuristics or file-based signatures to block activity.\nExample:\nRansomware is trying to encrypt a file system. If standard Windows tools are used to start the encryption, anti-virus won't stop it because it's not malware per se. It's a Windows process doing its job. However, EDR would stop it because the process that kicks off the encryption isn't started by Windows security policy or other standard deployment methods. Endpoint detection and response works by observing endpoint and system events and recording the data in a focal database to facilitate examination, location, detailing, and alerting occurrences.\nWhat if I don't have an sfu managed devices?\nSFU faculty and staff without managed devices are encouraged to opt-in to being managed, which allows for continual software updates and enhanced security via the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). This provides greater cyber security measures for SFU IT systems. Contact your local IT support to opt-in to having your device managed. For general assistance,\nGet Help\nfrom the Service Desk.\nFor unmanaged devices, IT Services has secured some licenses for\nTrend Micro Apex One\n, an enterprise class endpoint security software. It is available to faculty and staff through March 19, 2025.\nWhat do I do if my application is blocked by edr?\nPlease submit a block review request via the\nEDR service page\n.",

Site Owners will need to setup the syncing. See\nSetup Sync Connection\nfor instructions.\nMEMBERSHIP SYNCING AND MICROSOFT SECURITY GROUPS\nAbout every hour, a membership sync will happen between your SFU Groups Security Groups and its linked Microsoft Security Group. These Microsoft Security Groups are named:\nspo-<sitename>-members\nspo-<sitename>-owners\nspo-<sitename>-visitors\nThese Microsoft Security Groups can then be used in various places in Microsoft 365 at SFU. In this context however, these Microsoft Security Groups can be used to manage permissions on your SharePoint Online site.\nFor an architectural diagram on the syncing:\nPlease note the following syncing behaviours:\nBy default, adding or removing members to your security groups on SFU Groups will not do anything. Site Owners will need to setup the syncing. See\nSetup Sync Connection\nfor instructions.\nContrary to the behaviour in Microsoft Teams\n, any users added directly in\nSharePoint via Site Access\nare not affected by the sync from security groups.\nHOW TO ADD AUTOMATION\nFor standard SFU Groups users:\nThose who are not Grouper Admins will need to contact their local IT support staff for assistance with setting up automation. You may refer them to this page on how to add automation to your SPO site.\nOnce you are given a reference group with your specified automation needs from your local IT support staff (e.g.,\nref:dept:its:dto:my-site-group\n), you will need to add this group as a member to your SPO Security Group.\nVisit\nSFU Groups Add or Remove Members\nfor instructions on how to add a member to a SFU Group.\nVisit\nWhere to find my Sites' Security Group\nif you don't know where to find your SPO Security Group.\nFor technical group manager (Grouper Admins):\nGrouper Admins are those who have access to the full-weight Grouper application (\ngrouper.its.sfu.ca\n).\nTo add automation to SPO site membership or permissions, it is generally recommended to add\na basis group\nas a member to the security groups for your site. Which basis group you should add depends who should be synced to the SPO site. Basis groups are usually auto-populated, group membership data coming from system of record, meaning, there will be automated on boarding and off boarding to your SPO site permissions once set up with a basis group.\nFor a more defined group, you may want to use\ncomposite groups\nto create filters or conditions to narrow down a particular basis group or multiple basis groups.\nIf you are setting up automation on behalf of a user, create a reference group with the appropriate basis group / automation based on the user's needs. Then, provide the user READ permissions to the reference group and the reference group (full path). This will allow the user to add the reference group as a member to their SPO Security Group on SFU Groups (\ngroups.sfu.ca\n).\nAn example of the final result can be:\nresource:app:ADSFU:AzureGroups:SPO:spo-digital-transformation-office-members\n(which is managed by Site Owner)\ncontains\nref:dept:its:dto:my-site-group\n(which is managed by Local IT)\ncontains\nbasis:dept:12345\n(automatically includes any SFU staff from a specified unit/dept. based on HR data)\nVisit\nTechnical Documentation for Grouper\nfor more information about Grouper.\nSETUP SYNC CONNECTION\nTo setup your Microsoft Security Groups onto your SPO site for a sync connection:\nOn your SharePoint Online site, select\nSite Access\nnear the top-right corner.\nEnter the name of your Microsoft Security Group for your SPO site\n, spo-<sitename>-members\nor\nspo-<sitename>-owners\nor\nspo-<sitename>-visitors\n.\nSelect the Microsoft Security Group you wish to add.\nApply the proper permissions to the group:\nEdit\nfor site member permissions,\nFull Control\nfor site owner permissions or\nRead\nfor visitor permissions.\nSelect\nShare\n.\nConfirm if the Security Group has been added. You may want to ask a member from the Security Group to try accessing your site.\nNote\n: If you have recently made membership changes to the security group from SFU Groups, please wait an hour for the sync to finish.\nFor a list of available resources, visit\nSharePoint Online - How-To Guides\n.

    "clean_body_text": "Students\nHow-To Guides\nOVERVIEW\nThis article describes how to protect yourself from phishing email scams, which aim to steal your personal information.\nWhat is Phishing?\nSpotting a Phishing Attempt\nHow you can protect yourself?\nI Received a Phishing Attempt\nI Responded to a Phishing Attempt\nReport Phishing\nOutlook on the Web\n(with the Report Phishing button)\nOutlook on Desktop\n(copy message header and forwarding to abuse@sfu.ca)\nWhat is Phishing?\nTIP\nUnder no circumstances will SFU ever request our users to provide or confirm their computing ID and password using email messages. You should never send your SFU account credentials to anyone.\nSFU, like many other universities, is the subject of \"phishing\" attacks.\nPhishing is an attempt to acquire sensitive personal information\n, such as usernames, passwords and banking information by masquerading as a trustworthy party in an electronic communication. Phishing is typically carried out by email or instant messaging and often directs users to enter details at a website or in a email reply.\nThe term\nis a variant of\nfishing\nand alludes to the use of increasingly sophisticated baits used in the hope of a \"catch\" of personal information.\nSPOTTING A PHISHING ATTEMPT\nAbove is an example of a phishing attempt sent from a compromised SFU account.\nTIP\nPhishing scams will\nalways attempt to steal personal information.\nIf there are any\nsuspicious requests for your personal information\n, look for any indicators to determine if it may be a phishing attempt.\n1. The Sender\nThe Sender\n: The contents of the email message should match who sent the email. Also, be sure that the email ends with \"@sfu.ca\". As an example, IT related messages should come from an SFU IT staff or role account that ends with \"@sfu.ca\".\nAsk yourself,\ndoes it make sense for this individual to send the contents in the email message and was this sent from an SFU email?\nIn this example, a student account was sending this message on assistance programs which should raise some red flags.\n2. Format or layout\nFormat or Layout\n: Official SFU messages put in considerable effort not appear like phishing email. This includes introductions, additional context and support points, proper use of SFU logos, fonts, highlights and punctuation.\nAsk yourself,\ndoes this message contain sufficient information and proper use of formatting?\nIn this example, there is insufficient context around why you are eligible, and odd usages of SFU logo and punctuations.\n3. Honeypot or Threatening Language\nHoneypot or Threatening Language\n: Phishing emails tend to include language that incentives or threatens the user to take urgent action before a deadline, whether it may be a reward or consequence.\nAsk yourself,\nis this too good (or bad) to be true and if I'm being rushed?\nIn this example, it attempts to bait users to provide their information for financial incentives.\n4. Grammar Errors or Awkward Phrasing\nGrammar Errors or Awkward Phrasing\n: Similar to Point #2, official SFU messages put in considerable effort to ensure that there are no grammar errors or awkward phrasing. Although mistakes may happen, a significant number of typos, grammar errors or awkward phrasing can indicate phishing attempts if there are call to actions.\nAsk yourself,\nare there typos, grammar errors or awkward phrasing in the email message?\nIn this example, there are many incorrect usage of punctuations and awkward phrasing.\n5. External Links or Suspicious Attachments\nExternal Links or Suspicious Attachments\n: Official SFU messages make a conscious effort to let readers know where links will take them and if there are any attachments. Any form links should point to an SFU service, such as SFU's Microsoft Form or SurveyMonkey.\nFor attachments, in most cases, they should be office files, .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, .pptx. Be wary of any non-office files, unless you're expecting it to be.\nAsk yourself,\ndoes this link take me to website I've never seen before? Or, am I being asked to open an attachment I wasn't expecting?\nIn this example, the phishing message is attempting to persuade users to go to an unknown webform and fill out their personal information.\n6. Odd sign off and signature\nOdd Sign Off and Signature\n: The signature of the email message should match who (the account) is sending the email. Similar to Point #2, the sign off should be professionally written and formatted.\nAsk yourself,\ndoes the signature look strange and does it match with the sender?\nIn this example, the sign off does not match the sender. Additionally, the signature does not look professional.\nHow you can protect yourself?\nI RECEIVED A PHISHING ATTEMPT\nIf you receive an email message asking for your SFU Computing ID and password:\nNever provide your computing ID or password through email messages\nno matter how official or convincing request seems. SFU will never request to provide or confirm your computing ID and password using email messages.\nDont reply or respond. Simply delete the message or select 'Report' (if available).\nEven responding to the message with content such as \"please don't send me spam\" simply confirms to the sender that they have contacted a live email address and increases your odds of receiving more spam in the future.\nI RESPONDED TO A PHISHING ATTEMPT\nIf you have responded to a phishing message with your SFU Computing ID and password,\nchange your password immediately.\nYou can change your SFU password at\nSFU Computing Account\n.\nIf your SFU Computing Account has been compromised and subsequently locked,\ncontact IT Services by phone or in-person\n.\nReport Phishing\nTo report phishing, use Outlook's\nReport Phishing\nbutton. Alternatively, you may also forward any phishing messages to\nabuse@sfu.ca\nwith its\nmessage header\nif the button is not available.\nSee the instructions:\nOutlook on the Web\n(with the Report Phishing button)\nOutlook on Desktop\n(copy message header and forwarding to abuse@sfu.ca)\nOUTLOOK ON THE WEB\nSelect the phishing message from the inbox.\nSelect\nReport > Report Phishing\n.\nThank you for reporting illegitimate messages! Our SFU Exchange administrators will receive the report and will take further action to minimize the impact to our community.\nOUTLOOK ON DESKTOP\nDouble-click the email message\nfrom your inbox to pop-out the message.\nSelect\nFiles > Properties\n.\nOn the\nInternet Headers\nbox,\nRight-Click > Select All\n, then\nRight Click > Copy\nto copy the entire message header.\nGo back to the phishing message and select\nForward\n.\nOn the Message Field,\nRight-Click > Paste\nto paste the entire message header.\nOn the To Field, enter\nabuse@sfu.ca\n. Then, select\nSend\n.\nThank you for reporting illegitimate messages! Our SFU Exchange administrators will receive the report and will take further action to minimize the impact to our community.\nFor a list of available guides and documentation, see\nSFU Mail - How-To Guides\n.",

Whether you're new to Teams or looking to enhance your collaboration experience, this guide will help you navigate shared channels with ease.\nWHAT ARE SHARED CHANNELS?\nShared channels in MS Teams\nallow you to collaborate seamlessly with colleagues across different teams even if they are not direct members of the hosting team. It's like having a meeting spot where everyone can gather and share ideas, files, and conversations all in one place without needing to become team members themselves. This ensures members of your team can collaborate with others without sharing all the content in your team.\nHow to Create a Shared Channel\nCreating a shared channel is a simple process. Here’s how you can do it:\nOpen Microsoft Teams and navigate to the team where you want to create the shared channel.\nClick on the three dots (...) next to the team's name.\nSelect Add a channel.\nName your channel and add a description if you like.\nUnder \"Choose channel type\", select \"Shared - People you choose from your org and other orgs have access\".\nFinally, click Create.\nFor more detailed instructions, view the Microsoft support article\nCreate a shared channel in Microsoft Teams\n.\nExternal Collaboration Limits at SFU\nAt SFU, shared channels are designed for internal collaboration, making it easier for departments and project teams to work together while keeping the team itself private to members. However, SFU does not have Business-to-Business (B2B) connections with other organizations that allow external users to access shared channels at this time.\nTips for Using Shared Channels\nShared channels offer a range of features to enhance your collaboration:\nShared Channel Owner and Member Roles in Microsoft Teams\nGuest and Shared Channels in Microsoft Teams\nManage Shared Channels in Microsoft Teams",

Security groups contain a list of SFU members and can be synced to multiple services or resources to provide access, assign privileges or provision licensing.\nThe group manager(s) can then add or remove SFU members as needed, which will then sync to provision (or de-provision) access to connected services or resources.\nHere are some examples of security groups that can be used with:\nCreating group-managed teams on Microsoft Teams\nVisit restricted websites on Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)\nAccess to printers and labs\nAuto-populated Exchange Distribution Groups\nSome security groups may be called reference groups if they are managed by departments or staff. This is to distinguish from policy groups (also security groups) which are managed by IT service managers and IT admins.\nGROUP REVIEWS\nAll security groups are\nrequired to be periodically reviewed\nto certify that their membership is accurate, up-to-date and that the group is still needed or in use on SFU Groups. Please note by managing a security group, you'll be responsible for its periodic reviews.\nREMINDER\nSecurity Groups\ncan\nonly contain SFU members\n. If you require an external user to access SFU resources, such as a vendor or contractor, they will need an\nSFU Sponsored Account\n.\nWho can request a Security Group?\nOnly staff and faculty\nmay request security groups if needed for a service or resource. For example, if you wish to use a\ngroup-managed Teams\n, it will ask for a reference group (a type of security group).\nRequests for security groups are reviewed and created by IT Services or your departmental IT staff.\nHow to request a Security Group\nSTEP 1\nReach out to your dedicated Grouper IT Admin to request a security group.\nFor academic staff or faculty:\nContact your\ndepartment's IT support staff\nto request a security group.\nFor administrative staff:\nContact your\nIT support staff\nto request a security group. If you are unsure, contact the\nIT Service Desk\n.\nSTEP 2\nOnce your security group has been created and you've been given manager permissions, you can find your new security group on\nSFU Groups\nunder\nManage your Groups\n.\nWhen services or resources are asking for a security group (or reference group), provide the entire group name in blue. For example,\nref:dept:its:dept:demo-members\nis the group name for the security group in the screenshot above.\nSTEP 3 (OPTIONAL)\nYou may want to consider\nautomated or auto-populated membership\nfor your security groups. For example, you may want your security group to include members from a particular department, unit, course, academic plan, affiliation, or other system of record information.\nThis method of membership allows for automatic onboarding or offboarding for anyone who changes roles without manual adjustments on your security groups.\nFor more information or if you are interested, contact your\nIT support staff\nwho created the security group on your behalf.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor questions about Group Management or SFU Groups:\nVisit our\nSFU Groups FAQ\n.\nFor additional assistance:\nRequest a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nGroup Management\nGroup Management simplifies access management by letting you use the same group or role across many services at SFU.",

For example, when you request a team in MS Teams you're actually creating a Microsoft 365 group in the background.\nThis core group helps you manage the membership, access and collaboration between other Microsoft 365 services so you can focus on a single consistent experience with your team; rather than managing access to multiple Microsoft services.\nFor example, when you create a new team in MS Teams a Microsoft 365 group is created that:\nSets the security and access rules for the initial team owner, who can then manage additional owners/members.\nCreates and coordinates the online storage space the group will use to store documents and content.\nCreates and coordinates the underlying communication space so the group can chat with each other.\nMaintains the membership to other Microsoft 365 apps the team may need (such as Planner...etc).\nWhen does a Microsoft 365 group expire?\nUnless you manually delete a team/Microsoft 365 group, it will automatically expire 2-years after the date of last activity. After a group is deleted (either due to inactivity or someone chooses to delete it) it will a go into 30-day grace period where it can be\nrestored by IT Services\nupon request. However, after the grace period ends the group will be permanently deleted and any documents or content associated with the group will be lost.\nHow do I know if my Microsoft 365 group is about to expire?\nAnyone with an ownership role (e.g. Team Owner) in the group will be notified 30, 15, and 1 day before their group is about to expire. This notification will be sent to the SFU email address of group owners. Additionally, a reminder will be sent from the activity feed on MS Teams.\nYou can also check the expiration date of your group in MS Teams. For more information see\nTeam Expiration and Renewal\n.\nSecurity Tip: Expiration notices will be sent from an email address that ends in\nmicrosoft.com\n. Be cautious of impostor emails.\nHow do I renew a Team (and Microsoft 365 group)?\nIf you are an owner of a team (Microsoft 365 group), you can renew it by following the instructions in the notification email. Additionally, see\nRenew a team in Microsoft Teams\nfor information on how to renew a team in the MS Teams app directly.\nWhat keeps a Team/Microsoft 365 group active?\nWhile lots of Microsoft apps use groups, any of the following activity will keep a Team/Microsoft 365 group in an active state:\nSharePoint - View, edit, download, move, share, or upload files.

    "clean_body_text": "Software and Application Distribution\nMicrosoft\nCopilot\nAs with any new technology, how you interact with it will determine what you get out of it. While a generative AI is designed to be conversational you can design your questions (\nprompts\n) to influence responses. How you craft your prompts to draw out specific behaviours is referred to as\nprompting engineering\n.\nWhat's included:\nGetting Started\nAdditional Techniques for Better Prompts\nGetting Started\nA well-crafted prompt acts like a clear set of instructions—it helps the AI understand not just what you want, but\nhow\nyou want it delivered. To make your interactions more effective and efficient, great starter prompts typically include four key elements:\nYour\ngoal\n(i.e., what you want the AI assistant to accomplish)\nYour\ncontext\n(i.e., extra details that will help the AI assistant understand your question)\nYour\nsources\n(i.e., additional content that the AI assistant can reference to help respond)\nYour\nexpectations\n(i.e., the essentials you'd like included in the respose)\nLet's take a look at an example of goal, context, sources, and expectations (\nGCSE\n) in action.\nGoal\nContext\nSource\nExpectations\nGenerate a short summary and 3-5 bullet points\nto prepare me for a meeting with project sponsors.\nFocus on the main points from this document Project-Summary.docx.\nUse simple language so I can get up to speed quickly. Include project costs, timelines, and scope in the bullet points.\nExplore how it's done on\nMicrosoft Support:\nTips and Tricks for Prompts in Copilot\nIterate and Regenerate\nGreat responses often emerge through refining your questions. Don’t settle for the first result—use iteration to improve clarity, tone, and completeness.\nTips:\nUse feedback loops: Tell Copilot what worked and what didn’t.\nAsk for variations: “Give me three alternative versions,” or “Make it more concise.”\nPrompt Engineering Techniques for Better Prompts\nOnce you've got the foundational elements of a good prompt—goal, context, sources, and expectations (\nGCSE\n)—you can weave in more advanced techniques to enhance your interactions with AI tools. Think of these as additional approaches to\nhelp guide the assistant with greater precision, whether you're drafting communications, analyzing data, solving problems, or generating creative content.\nRole Based Prompting\nGiving Copilot a role helps add context so it can tailor responses to your needs. This is commonly used when you need to change the default behaviour of how Copilot responds. For example, responding in a specific communication style (\"\nSpeak like Shakespeare\n\") or acting in a tailored way (\"\nExplain this like a math tutor for a 10 year old\n\").\nTips:\nAssign a role: “Act as a project manager,” “You’re a career coach,” etc.\nProvide background: Mention the audience, purpose, or scenario.\nExamples\nAct as a university administrative coordinator preparing a communication for students about upcoming registration deadlines from\nhttps://www.sfu.ca/students/deadlines\n. Make the tone clear, professional, and supportive.\nAct as a professor designing a syllabus for an introductory psychology course based on the material from my_class.docx. Include learning objectives, weekly topics, and assessment methods.\nAct as a teaching assistant preparing a study guide for undergraduate students in a biology course based on topics from this PowerPoint presentation week4.pptx. Include key concepts, sample questions, and tips for exam preparation.\nProviding Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)\nAnother technique is showing examples that can help Copilot learn the pattern or style you want. This is often used when you need Copilot to format results in a specific way. For example, matching the tone of previous emails or creating tables with specific column headers.\nTips:\nInclude 1–3 examples of the desired output.\nKeep examples short and consistent.\nUse this technique for formatting, tone, or structure.\nExamples\nI'm trying to write a reminder email to students about upcoming tuition deadlines posted at\nhttps://www.sfu.ca/students/deadlines\n. Here's an example I have so far:\n“Hi everyone,\nJust a quick reminder that Fall tuition payments are due by September 15. Please check your student portal for details. Let us know if you have any questions!”\nHelp we write a similar reminder about when grades will be posted. Include links to\nhttps://www.sfu.ca/students/deadlines\nfor more information.\nI'm writing concise feedback on student essays for a french studies course in a constructive and encouraging tone. Here are a few examples:\n“\nExcellent travail de connexion entre la théorie et la pratique - votre analyse du comportement social était perspicace.\n”\n“\nEnvisagez d'élargir votre discussion sur les influences culturelles pour renforcer votre argument.\n”\nCan you help me write feedback for the following paper student_paper.docx. I need to phrase my feedback in a way that encourages them to keep exploring digital learning trends in 1-2 sentences.\nHelp me create study notes for my psychology exam. Use the format below. Examples:\nTopic:\nClassical Conditioning\nKey Concept:\nLearning through association\nExample:\nPavlov’s dogs salivating at the sound of a bell\nImportant Terms:\nUnconditioned stimulus, conditioned response\nTopic:\nOperant Conditioning\nKey Concept:\nBehavior shaped by rewards and punishments\nExample:\nA student receives praise for completing homework\nImportant Terms:\nReinforcement, punishment, behavior modification\nNow create study notes for the topic “Cognitive Dissonance.” based on the material from week4slides.pptx.\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting\nChain-of-Thought prompting encourages Copilot to reason step-by-step, improving accuracy and depth. This is often used when you need Copilot to check it's assumptions by breaking down complex ideas, or providing transparency when it responses.\nTips:\nAsk Copilot to explain its reasoning.\nBreak complex tasks into smaller steps.\nUse phrases like “Let’s think step by step” or “First, identify…”\nExamples\nLet’s think step by step: How can we improve employee engagement in a hybrid work environment?\nExplain how the peer review process works in academic publishing. First, outline the key stages, then describe the role of reviewers and editors.\nI’m preparing a training session for new faculty on inclusive teaching practices. Let’s break this into steps: first, define inclusive teaching; second, list common challenges; third, suggest practical strategies.\nRelated Articles (5)\nAdditional Learning Resources for Copilot\nResources and learning paths that can help you get started with Microsoft 365 Copilot.\nCopilot Agents\nExplore how to use Copilot Agents to expand and tailor your experience within Microsoft Copilot.\nCopilot Chat\nLearn about Copilot Chat, a generative AI assistant on the Microsoft 365 platform that is available to everyone at SFU.\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot\nLearn more about Microsoft 365 Copilot (a personalized productivity AI assistant) at SFU.\nPrivacy and Security Guidance for using Microsoft 365 Copilot\nLearn about privacy and security guidance for using Copilot at SFU.",

    "clean_body_text": "Teaching and Learning\nLearning Management\nTRANSITIONING TO CANVAS CLOUD ONLINE WORKSHOP\nCenter for Educational Excellence (CEE) is offering online workshops to the SFU teaching community to explore new features in Canvas Cloud and its overall structure and interface.\nSee CEE’s\nworkshop and events page\nfor available dates.\nACCESS CANVAS\nCanvas On-Premise (current):\ncanvas.sfu.ca\nCanvas Cloud (new):\ncanvas-new.sfu.ca\n.\nNote\n: The Canvas Cloud web link is only temporary during this transition.\nMore details here\n.\nOVERVIEW\nSFU is transitioning from a locally hosted (on-premise) version of Canvas to a cloud-based version (Canvas Cloud). This means that instead of being managed on SFU’s own servers, Canvas will now be hosted on Instructure’s cloud platform.\nStarting in Spring 2026, all courses at SFU will be hosted on the new Canvas Cloud platform, which is based in Canada.\nWhy is this happening?\nWho is affected?\nWhat do instructors need to do?\nHow will this impact students?\nHow will I access Canvas Cloud?\nResources & Links\nFAQs\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING?\nSFU currently uses an on-premise version of Canvas that is becoming obsolete. As a result, the on-premise version is facing growing performance challenges, as well as falling behind in features and functionality compared to the vendor-supported Canvas Cloud.\nTransitioning to Canvas Cloud will provide a more reliable platform and access to new tools and capabilities, including enhanced quiz functionality, annotation features in SpeedGrader, and advanced analytics.\nThis change aligns with\nWhat’s Next: The SFU Strategy\nand reflects SFU IT Services’ commitment to leveraging technology to enhance the university experience for students, instructors and staff.\nWHO IS AFFECTED?\nAnyone who uses Canvas at SFU. For example, students, instructors, lifelong learners and staff.\nWHAT DO INSTRUCTORS NEED TO DO?\nFor instructors teaching courses in Spring 2026:\nAttend sessions on the new platform\noffered by the Centre for Educational Excellence (CEE)\n.\nIf required, migrate course content from the on-premise Canvas to Canvas Cloud\nusing IT Services’ course migration tool\n.\nBuild, test and troubleshoot your Spring 2026 course\nin Canvas Cloud\n.\nScenario 1: I am building a new course for Spring 2026\nIf you are teaching a course in Spring 2026 and plan to build your course from scratch, you can start building your course in Canvas Cloud now. To access Canvas Cloud, visit\ncanvas-new.sfu.ca\n.\nScenario 2: I want to reuse content from a previous course for Spring 2026\nIf you are teaching a course in Spring 2026 and wish to use content from a previous course taught in the on-premise version of Canvas, you can migrate that course content to the new Canvas Cloud platform. IT Services has a course migration tool to support this process, along with guides to support its use:\nHow to migrate a Credit Course\n.\nFor instructors teaching courses in a semester after spring 2026:\nInstructors who are not teaching in spring 2026 do not need to migrate their courses at this time and will retain access to their courses.\nThe current Canvas platform will eventually be retired, but the retirement date has not yet been determined. Once a date is set, we will communicate it to all instructors well in advance.\nHOW TO MIGRATE A CREDIT COURSE\nCourses tied to a degree or certificate academic program.\nHOW TO MIGRATE A NON-ACADEMIC COURSE\nCourses that generally facilitate training, orientation or other activities.\nNote\n: Instructors teaching in Spring 2026 can find their credit course shell on the\nCanvas Cloud Dashboard\nstarting September 2025. Credit course shells will now appear automatically on their Canvas Cloud Dashboard once assigned in goSFU — instructors don’t need to request one using the 'Start a New Course' tool. Students will be automatically added at the start of Spring 2026. For details, see\nChanges to Credit Course Shell Creation\n.\nHOW WILL THIS IMPACT STUDENTS?\nStudents will access and navigate Canvas Cloud much like the on-premise version of Canvas, with a modernized interface and enhanced user experience. This change will allow them to experience a more innovative and reliable platform.\nStudents who wish to retain customizations to their profile will need to manually re-configure them. This includes personal files, biography information, profile photo, inbox messages, ePortfolio, notification settings and any other profile customizations.\nHOW WILL I ACCESS CANVAS CLOUD?\nTo access to Canvas Cloud:\nVISIT CANVAS-NEW.SFU.CA\nNote:\nStarting January 2026, canvas.sfu.ca will be directed to Canvas Cloud. The web link, canvas-new.sfu.ca is only temporary during this transition.\nRESOURCES & LINKS\nCOURSE MIGRATION TOOL\nmigrate.its.sfu.ca\nHOW TO GUIDES\nHow to migrate a Credit Course\nHow to migrate a Non-Academic Course\nHow to migrate Users to another Course\nCANVAS CLOUD & CHANGES\nCanvas Differences between On-premise and Cloud\nChanges to Credit Course Shell Creation\nStorage in Canvas Cloud\nLTI Installation in Canvas Cloud\n(coming soon)\nFAQs\nMIGRATION AND TIMELINE\nWhen is the transition to Canvas Cloud happening?\nStarting in Spring 2026, all courses will be delivered through Canvas Cloud and\ncanvas.sfu.ca\nwill be directed to Canvas Cloud.\nInstructors can begin building or migrating courses to the new Canvas Cloud platform in September 2025.\nA small group of volunteer instructors will have early access to Canvas Cloud for testing and trial purposes.\nIf I am not teaching in Spring 2026 do I still need to move my courses from the current version of Canvas to the new cloud version by January?\nWe recommend that instructors move as many courses as they wish to keep to Canvas Cloud by January 2026. However, if you’re unable to migrate all your courses by that date, please note that you will not lose access to your remaining courses.\nThe current Canvas platform will eventually be retired, but the retirement date has not yet been determined. Once a date is set, we will communicate it to all instructors well in advance.\nReminder that after January 2026, you can continue to access courses on the current platform using the following link:\ncanvas-old.sfu.ca\n(accessible after January 2026)\nWhich of my past courses will be migrated to Canvas Cloud?\nAs instructors are the experts on what courses and course content they wish to maintain, they are responsible for migrating courses from the on-premise version of Canvas to Canvas Cloud. IT Services will provide a course migration tool to support this process. Visit\nHow to Migrate a Credit Course\nfor step-by-step instructions.\nIf your course is non-academic, such as courses that facilitate training, orientation or other activities, visit\nHow to migrate a Non-Academic Course\nfor step-by-step instructions.\nHow long will it take me to complete the course migration process?\nCourse migrations with the\ncourse migration tool\nshould only take a few minutes to complete, subject to possible system delays during peak periods.\nAfter migration, instructors will need to review the course for any issues and make necessary adjustments. In rare cases, links to media files or third-party tools (LTIs) may not transfer correctly and may need to be manually updated.\nWhat content can’t be migrated to Canvas Cloud? Will I need to rebuild anything?\nCOURSE\nAll course materials, or content created by instructors, can be migrated using the\ncourse migration tool\n. In rare cases, links to media files or third-party tools (LTIs) may not transfer correctly and may need to be manually updated. Student work and enrolment-related data also cannot be migrated. Visit\nHow to Migrate a Credit Course\nfor a detailed list.\nPROFILE\nProfile content cannot be migrated and will need to be rebuilt. This includes personal files, biography information, profile photo, inbox messages, ePortfolio and any other profile customizations.\nCan I continue to teach courses in the on-premise version of Canvas after Spring 2026?\nNo, starting Spring 2026, all credit and non-credit courses should be taught in Canvas Cloud. Instructors can start developing their Spring 2026 courses in Canvas Cloud during the Fall 2025 semester.\nExceptions to this can be\nsome non-academic courses with unique circumstances\n.\nI am new to Canvas Cloud.

What do I do?\nSpring 2026 course shells will be automatically created and assigned to instructors. Instructors should see their course shells on the Canvas Cloud dashboard by early September.\nIf your course does not appear on your dashboard you can request the course as you normally would using\n'Start a New Course'\nstarting October 2025 on Canvas Cloud. You may also want to check with your department’s administrative staff to confirm your course assignment on goSFU.\nCOURSE RETENTION AND RETIREMENT\nI am an instructor. what happens to past courses I have taught in the on-premise version of Canvas after we transition to Canvas Cloud?\nAfter the transition to Canvas Cloud, Canvas On-premise will be accessible using canvas-old.sfu.ca starting in January 2026. More information about the eventual retirement of the on-premise Canvas courses will be shared at a later date.\nI am concerned about losing access to student content in past courses. What if I want to refer to past student materials to write a reference letter, such as assessments, individual grades, assignments?\nInstructors who would like to keep student-generated content will need to download this content. Instructors can download the Gradebook for a record of student grades.\nCanvas On-premise will be accessible using canvas-old.sfu.ca starting in January 2026. More information about the eventual retirement of the on-premise Canvas courses will be shared at a later date.\nCanvas also provides a way to download student submissions, but this must be done for each assignment. More information on this is available through\nCanvas’s Instructor Guide\n.\nWill content on Canvas on-premise be permanently deleted in the future?\nSFU's Archives and Records Management Department is currently updating the course data retention schedule based on community feedback. The updated schedule will undergo broad consultation and is likely to be completed in 2026 to ensure accuracy and completeness.\nUntil the new schedule is finalized, nothing will be permanently deleted from Canvas Cloud or Canvas On-Prem.​\nWill the retention period for courses in Canvas be long enough to satisfy departmental and instructor requirements?\nThe Archives and Records Management Department (ARMD) is in the early stages of drafting a Records Retention Schedule and Disposal Authority (RRSDA) and anticipates broader stakeholder consultation on this RRSDA in 2026.\nAt this time, no changes to retention practices are being implemented.\nRRSDAs are drafted and approved under the authority of\nI 10.01 Archives, Recorded Information Management, & Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy\n.\nAs with all RRSDAS, ARMD consults with key stakeholders to ensure that records retention periods reflect the administrative, fiscal, and/or legal value of the information, the historic or archival value of the information while balancing the privacy rights of information subjects, and the cost associated with maintaining the information over-time. Information stored in Canvas (regardless of where it is hosted - Cloud or on-premises) includes the intellectual property of instructors as well as the personal information of students.\nThe RRSDA will consider all factors and establish a retention period that is long enough to satisfy departmental/university needs (such as ensuring information is available for accreditation processes, academic integrity, student performance monitoring programs, etc.), instructor needs (such as ensuring information is available for repurposing in future courses, completing reference letters, etc.), while ensuring requirements of the Copyright Act and Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act are met.\nDATA PRIVACY\nWhere are the servers for the new Canvas Cloud located?\nThe servers hosting SFU’s Canvas Cloud are located in Canada.\nHow secure is my content on Canvas Cloud? Where can I find privacy and compliance information on Instructure?\nInformation on privacy can be found on\nInstructure’s Trust Center\n.\nWill my content be used to train artificial intelligence models and tools?\nNo, Instructure has a strong statement on the protection of customer data. Canvas Cloud will provide AI features on its platform where no customer data will be used to train any AI feature model.\nData will only be shared to AI models when you choose to use Canvas Cloud AI features to generate prompts. These models are housed internally by Instructure and no data ever leaves their data center in Canada. For further details, visit\nAI Nutrition Facts on Canvas Discussion Summaries\n.\nNote\n: At this time, AI features on Canvas are disabled globally.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor pedagogical or instructional design questions:\nContact ceehelp@sfu.ca.\nFor additional assistance or technical support:\nRequest a support ticket using\nCanvas - Request Help\n.

It also outlines the key differences between Exchange Distribution Groups and Security Groups, helping users understand how to manage access and permissions effectively.\nWhat is a group?\nType of Groups\nTraining Videos\nComparison Chart\nWhat is a group?\nIn SFU Groups,\ngroups\nare used to organize users who have similar roles or responsibilities. Think of a group as a team or a club: when you add users to a group, you can manage their access to resources and privileges all at once, instead of doing it individually for each user.\nSince SFU is a large and complex organization, managing groups instead of individual users ensures our resources are organized and secure. It also makes sure that only the right people can access certain resources.\nType of Groups\nIn SFU Groups, there are\ntwo types of groups\nfor the standard user:\nExchange Distribution Groups\nand\nSecurity Groups\n.\nExchange Distribution Groups\n(EDGs, or distribution groups) is a feature of\nMicrosoft Exchange (SFU's email system)\nthat allows a user to send messages to a list of SFU email addresses, or to members of other SFU Groups, all at once.\nFor more information, visit\nRequest an Exchange Distribution Group\n.\nSecurity groups\n(or reference groups) are used for security or access control to services or resources. Security groups contain a list of SFU members and can be synced to multiple services or resources to provide access, assign privileges or provision licensing.\nFor more information, visit\nRequest a Security Group (Reference Group)\n.\nSome security groups may be called reference groups if they are managed by departments or staff.

Your existing access control maillists will continue to work for the medium-term future (see below). Read more about:\nSFU's transition\nfrom maillists to Exchange Distribution Groups, SimpleLists, and Campaigner\nGrouper, SFU's new access control and group management system\nWhat do I need to do?\nGather a list\nof affected labs and users. (see \"Can I get a list of labs/file shares...\" below)\nCreate reference groups\nfor each lab. Grouper best practices advise you to create small groups (e.g.,\nref:dept:cmns:labX_members\nand\nref:dept:cmns:labX_admins\n) and add those groups to a larger composite group (e.g.,\nref:dept:cmns:labX_all\n). This allows easy separation of user and admin privileges on Linux hosts and finer-grained management of mailing lists.\nSync your reference groups to Active Directory\nby creating new groups under\nresource:app:ADSFU:SFUGroups.\nActive Directory groups require unique names, so it would be wise to prefix these group names with your school or department name. (Repetition of unit names is discouraged elsewhere in Grouper.) Create e.g.,\nresource:app:ADSFU:SFUGroups:cmns_labX_members.\nAdd the group\nref:dept:cmns:labX_members\nto\nresource:app:ADSFU:SFUGroups:cmns_labX_members\n.\n(Do not add individual users to the\nresource:...\ngroup; add the reference group itself.)\nContact\nresearch-support@sfu.ca\nwith the lab name and group information you used in Step 3.\nWhen do I need to do this?\nActive Directory groups based on maillists will be purged in the medium-term future since they can no longer be updated and thus pose a security risk. An exact date has not been announced but it would be advisable to complete your transition to Grouper by the end of 2025.\nCan I get a list of labs/file shares that I need to update?\nYes! Send an e-mail to\nresearch-support@sfu.ca\nand specify which department/school/unit you're in.\nWill RCG be contacting labs directly?\nDue to limited staffing and a campus-wide user base, we will reach out to users that have not made the transition to Grouper later this year or early next year.\nI use maillists for both access control and e-mail. What should I do?\nYou should still follow \"\nWhat do I need to do?\n\" above. Afterwards, if you need to:\nreach SFU members (and only SFU members),\ncreate an Exchange Distribution Group\n.\nreach internal and external users,\nuse SimpleLists\n.\nreach a large number of external users,\nuse Campaigner\n.",

NAC provides robust protection against vulnerabilities and enhances overall network security.\nSee the network flow diagram for Surrey, Vancouver, and Burnaby.\nDETAILS\nBenefits:\nEnhanced Security: NAC ensures that only compliant devices can securely access the network, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches\nComprehensive Visibility: Real-time monitoring and reporting provide complete visibility into endpoint compliance and network access activities\nSimplified Management: Centralized management of health-check settings and policies simplifies troubleshooting and compliance reporting.\nNAC FAQs\nWhat is Network Access Control (NAC)?\nNAC is a security enhancement tool that ensures only authenticated users and authorized, compliant devices can access SFU’s network, protecting your data and work. NAC strengthens SFU’s defenses against cyber threats and aligns with the goals of\nWhat’s Next: the SFU Strategy\nand the\nSFU IT Plan\n.\nWhen will NAC be implemented?\nSurrey Campus: April 2025\nVancouver Campus: June 2025\nBurnaby Campus: October 2025\nCan I opt out?\nIf you are on a managed PC or MAC, NAC will automatically roll out to your machine. This is an essential security service.\nAm I being tracked?\nOnly your\nmanaged machine is verified on the SFU network; no data is being tracked – NAC does not view your files or web traffic.\nWill this affect my ability to connect to SFU’s network?\nYou will experience no changes in accessing the SFU network at this time. In the near future, compliant managed devices and self-managed devices will be pointed to different networks for security purposes.\nWhat is a managed device?\nFor VPFA staff, managed devices refers to desktops and laptops that are managed by IT Services.\nIf you are part of faculty, you may want to consult with your local IT group as to whether your device is managed by your local IT group or by IT Services.\nStaff and faculty can enroll their devices purchased through SFU's Procurement Services into managed devices, to benefit from standards that ensure the device is secure, license compliant, connected to enterprise resources, and regularly updated and maintained. Managed devices can also be found in offices, lecture rooms, labs, and libraries on campuses.\nSee\nManaged Computer Services\nfor more details.\nHow does nac impact sfu managed devices?\nYou\ndon’t need to take any action and won’t notice any changes on your managed device unless there’s a network compliance issue. NAC operates quietly in the background, ensuring secure access to SFU’s network. You may notice a new NAC icon in the menu bar or system tray of your device. This icon indicates the system is actively managing your network connection to ensure compliance.\nWhat if I\ndon’t have an SFU managed device?\nSelf-managed devices will move to a different network and may have future network limitations\n.\nWho should I contact if I have questions or encounter issues?\nPlease contact the Network Services team at\nns-help@sfu.ca\nif you have questions.\nTo report an issue, you or your local IT admin can create a ticket in\nTDNext\n.\nFor Local IT Staff:\nWhat actions are\nrequired from Local IT?\nLocal IT should check the common local security control points:\nLocal OS (Mac, Windows, Linux), investigate local firewalls\nMac and Linux hosts - check \"allow.host\" and \"deny.host\"\nWindows clients - check group policies\nDedicated firewall rules or ACLs on networking equipment\nCentral IT will adjust the 172.16 IP space rules where known, but Local IT should reach out to SFU Cloud if there are specific rules to be changed on individual servers.\nIf Local IT groups are unsure of which static IP addresses are under their control, a IT helpdesk ticket can be created to identify the domains and associated IP addresses.\nWill NAC affect our faculty's specialized equipment?\nIT Services will work directly with Local IT teams to ensure proper configuration and continuity of service for specialized equipment.\nWhat about systems with fixed IP addresses?\nIT Services will work with local IT to manage the transition to DHCP and provide specific instructions when action is needed.

For a quick visual overview on creating an agent, see:\nCreating agents in Copilot\n.\nAs you create an agent, you'll be able to provide:\nInstructions that tell it how to act an behave.\nKnowledge sources that tell it what it should know.\nInstructions\nInstructions define how your Copilot Agent should act and respond. For example, instructions for a \"tutor agent\" can change it's behaviour so it challenges you to explain your reasoning when answering questions rather than simply providing you with answers.\nInstructions should include:\nPurpose\nGeneral guidelines, including general directions, tone, and restrictions\nSkills\nIn addition, when relevant, instructions include:\nStep-by-step instructions\nError handling and limitations\nFeedback and iteration\nInteraction examples\nNon-standard terms\nFollow-up and closing\nTo learn more about effective instructions, see:\nWrite effective instructions for declarative (Copilot) agents\nBelow are also some examples of instructions to help you get started:\nIdea Coach\nYou are a personal assistant called Idea Coach, who helps to facilitate a brainstorming session and to plan brainstorming sessions.\nYou should use a fun, collaborative tone to inspire creativity.\n\nWhen you have questions you **must** only send questions one at a time to not overwhelm the user and to keep conversation bi-directional and multiturn. You should always contextualize the response you provide, based on the inputs the user has given you and their goal.\nAsk additional questions where necessary to clarify and confirm your understanding. Last but not the least **always ask** the user has and confirm if the user wants to make changes to any of your suggestions.\nAt the end of each interaction on a specific topic with the user ask how you did and recommend using the thumbs up and down feature in Copilot.\n\nYou should follow these guidelines for the following subjects:\n\nFor **Brainstorm a topic**: You should act as a session host and help brainstorm about a topic you will ask for. You need to be creative, engaging and ask your questions one by one to create a multiturn conversation flow with the user and help achieve their goal.\n\nFor **Planning a brainstorming session**: ensure you customize the agenda to the specific objectives, you should ask the user the following questions in sequential order, to ensure they provide the right context:\n- What is the brainstorming topic?\n- When do you want to run your workshop?\n- How long should the workshop be?\n- What are the ideation objectives?\n- Is the session in person remote or hybrid?\n- How many people will take part in the workshop\nYou should make detailed creative suggestions for topics and activities that should be discussed and used during each part of the agenda and incorporate the time suggested by the user into the agenda to make sure things run on time. You will write a detailed agenda that a knowledge worker could use to help them facilitate a brainstorming session with their colleagues on a particular topic.\nPlease format the agenda in tabular form, to include specific questions and discussion points for each phase.\n\nFor **helping find creative exercises**: Ask the user for the exercise objectives, the number of attendees and how long it should last. Then propose at least 3 exercises that would fit the user scenario.\n\nFor **Idea Organization**: Ask the user for more context about the exercises they ran, then propose some tools or technics to help prioritize the Ideas got from this brainstorming session. You should not prioritize the ideas the user provides you with but rather offer help to rate, prioritize those with no bias.\n\nFor **Feedback and Improvement**: Ask the user about the session, how it ran, how they felt about it, what was were the pain points, what was the output so you can provide some feedback. Your feedback should be structured with clear solutions to improve and you should open discussions with the user to see how you can help more.\n\nFor **Training and Development**: First ask the user if they want to improve some specifics skills or want to grow in general. Then ask the user to rate themself on Brainstorming Session on a scale of 1 to 10 and finally ask them 5 questions to assess the level based on the first response. Then provide a training plan to help them grow on the subject with training, exercises and technics.\n\nFor **Assess my skills**: Ask the user what skills they want to improve. Then ask the users 4 questions (one at the time) that would help you assess their level on the matter. Then share a direct and informative assessment of the user master ship and ask them if they want you to create a training plan.\nWriting COach\nYou are a Writing Coach. Your role is to provide detailed and constructive feedback on the following piece of writing and assist with writing tasks.\n\n**Skill 1: Coach me on an existing text**\n- Focus on clarity, coherence, grammar, syntax, tone, style, and overall impact.\n- Suggest specific improvements or alternatives.\n- Ask for the type of text (e.g., email, report, story) for tailored feedback.\n- Request the piece of writing for feedback.\n- Use a fun, collaborative tone to inspire creativity.\n\n**Skill 2: Help change the tone of an email or message**\n- Ask for the desired tone and specific points to highlight.\n- Provide examples of different tones (e.g., formal, casual, friendly).\n\n**Skill 3: Translate a piece of text into another language**\n- Ask if any cultural nuances should be considered.\n\n**Skill 4: Teach me how to write instructions**\n- Ask for a description of the feature to explain.\n- Write clear and concise instructions.\n- Ensure the instructions are easy to follow and understand.\n\n**Skill 5: Help me write a story**\n- Ask for details about the customer story (e.g., customer name, company, key points).\n- Assist in structuring the story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n- Provide suggestions to make the story engaging and impactful.\n\n**Skill 6: Help me write a whitepaper**\n- Assist with identifying the topics to cover.\n- Help define the target audience.\n- Provide guidance on the style (e.g., discussion, proof, pitch new idea).\n- Focus on enhancing clarity, coherence, and overall impact.\n- Suggest specific improvements or alternatives to make the whitepaper more engaging and effective.\n- At the end of each interaction on a specific topic with the user ask the user how you did and recommend the user to use the thumbs up and down.\nPresentation Planner\nYou are a declarative agent that helps give guidance on creating better slide presentations for executive audience.\n\nIf the user does not provide a duration of the presentation, please prompt the user for the duration.\nIf the user does not provide a slide with asks to the executives, please prompt the user to confirm they do not have any asks. Suggest if they don't to have any asks to provide a summary slide to wrap up the presentation.\n\nYou should follow these guidelines:\n1. Limit Text Quantity: 5/5/5 Rule: No more than 5 words per line, 5 lines of text per slide, and avoid more than 5 consecutive text-heavy slide.\n2. Focus on a Single Idea per Slide: Concentrate on one main point per slide to prevent overwhelming the audience and to maintain a clear narrative\n3. Maintain Consistent Design: Use uniform fonts, colors, and layouts throughout the presentation to create a cohesive and professional appearance\n4. Enhance Readability: Choose simple, sans-serif fonts like Arial or Calibri.Ensure text is large enough to be read from a distance; a minimum of 24-point font is recommended. Use high-contrast color combinations between text and background to improve visibility.\n5. Utilize Visuals Effectively: Incorporate relevant images, charts, and graphs to support and illustrate key points, aiding in audience comprehension.\n6. Incorporate White Space: Allow for adequate white space to prevent slides from appearing cluttered, helping to direct focus and improve readability.\n7. Get timing right: When adhering to the “one idea per slide” principle, the time spent on each slide can vary based on the complexity of the content and the overall length of your presentation. A general guideline is to spend approximately 1 to 2 minutes per slide. This pacing allows for a thorough explanation of each idea without overwhelming the audience. For instance, in a 20-minute presentation, you might have around 10 to 15 slides, dedicating about 1 to 2 minutes to each.\nMeeting summary and agenda planner\nYou are an administrative assistant at a learning institute, assisting an administrator in summarizing their recent meeting notes.\n\nInitial Inquiry: Begin by asking, \"Which department or team do you oversee, and what was the meeting's main topic?\"\n\nGathering Information: After receiving their response, request, \"Please provide the meeting notes or transcript.\" Once received, confirm, \"Is this the complete set of notes, or are there more?\" If more notes are available, ask for them. If not, proceed to the next step.\n\nSummary Goals: Ask, \"Would you like a summary? If yes, are there specific points or goals you'd like highlighted?\"\n\nCreating the Summary: Summarize the meeting, focusing on:\n\nKey takeaways\nConclusions\nRecommended next steps\nA proposed agenda for the subsequent meeting, prioritized by urgency, importance, and dependency.\nFor each point, use a bolded two-word heading for easy scanning.\n\nBrevity: Ensure the summary is concise, ideally no more than 10% of the original length and up to one page.\n\nFeedback: After presenting the summary, ask, \"Would you like any revisions or have additional input? I can also format this as a message for your team or supervisors.\"\n\nConclusion: Conclude by saying, \"Thank you for the information. Please let me know how I can further assist you.\"\n\nRemember to be methodical, ensuring you've gathered all necessary details before summarizing.\n\nWrap up the conversation by thanking and encouraging the administrator.\nAdditional examples (and credit) can be found at:\nMicrosoft Prompts for EDU\nKnowledge Sources\nKnowledge sources further inform your agent about what it should consider and specialize in so it can help answer your questions.\nIf you have\nCopilot Chat\n, you'll be able to add any publicly accessible website as a knowledge source.\nIf you have\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot\n, additional knowledge sources (such as SharePoint Online sites and documents) will be available.\nCopilot Agent Templates\nNot sure where to start when creating an agent, or creating one for the first time?

    "clean_body_text": "Software and Application Distribution\nMicrosoft\nPrivacy and Security Guidance for using Microsoft 365 Copilot\narticle, we introduced the\nS.A.F.E-A.I.\nprinciples — a way to help you engage with AI technologies responsibly and confidently. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at each principle, explore what they mean in practice and highlight how they’re being applied at SFU. By understanding and applying these principles, you’ll build the confidence and critical thinking skills needed to evaluate AI tools thoughtfully, ask the right questions and make responsible choices in your work.\nWhat's Included\nS\necure\nA\nccountable\nF\nair\nE\nxplainable (Transparency)\nA\nuditable (Safety & Reliability)\nI\nnclusive\nSecure\nOne of the most pressing aspects of responsible AI is addressing\nprivacy and security concerns\n. As AI systems, particularly generative AI, become more powerful, they introduce new risks to data security, personal privacy and even broader cybersecurity. There is a lot to consider in this section, so we'll outline some of the key concerns and challenges.\nData Privacy and Unintended Exposure\nAI systems often train on large data sets that include personal or proprietary information. A major concern is\nunintended data leakage\n– models might inadvertently expose sensitive information that was in the training data. For instance, if employees input confidential text into a generative AI service, that data might get used to further train the model and later emerge in another user’s output.\nGenerative AI models can “remember” fragments of their training data\n, raising the risk that private information (like a person's contact info or proprietary code) could be regurgitated in responses. As a precaution, many organizations limit what data can be fed into public AI tools and AI providers are working on techniques to better\nfilter or forget sensitive training data\n.\nNOTE:\nCopilot is is an institutionally reviewed AI solution that includes security and privacy guardrails to safeguard data; it's safe to use for work, study and research at SFU. Be careful when using non-reviewed public AI solutions, which can collect, store and use data you provide in unintended ways. You may be providing sensitive information to an entity that has no relationship, commitment, or responsibility to the university community.\nIntellectual Property and Copyright\nGenerative AI raises questions about intellectual property (IP). Models trained on vast internet data might output content that unintentionally\ncopycats copyrighted material\n. For example, a generative model might produce a passage of text almost identical to something in its training set (e.g., from a book or article), or an image model might generate something that resembles a specific artist’s work. This blurring of originality complicates who owns AI-generated content and whether using certain training data infringes copyrights. Organizations deploying generative AI must be careful to avoid legal issues from AI output.\nResponsible AI use entails respecting IP rights\n, perhaps by curating training data or allowing authors to opt out and by guiding users to use AI outputs ethically (not passing off AI-generated art as human-made if that violates terms, for instance).\nNOTE:\nCopilot is included in\nMicrosoft's Copyright Commitment\nwhich assumes legal responsibility for copyright challenges\nwithin reason\n. Do not use Copilot to infringe, misuse, or create harmful content related to intellectual property.\nRegulatory Compliance\nPrivacy laws like\nFIPPA\n(in B.C., Canada) or\nGDPR\n(in Europe) and various data protection regulations worldwide impose requirements on automated decision-making and data handling. Organizations using AI need to ensure\ncompliance\n, such as providing explanations for decisions, obtaining consent for personal data processing and enabling individuals to opt out of purely AI-based decisions. Future AI-specific regulations (like the proposed\nCanadian Artificial Intelligence Data Act\n) will likely enforce certain privacy and transparency standards. Staying ahead of these\ngovernance requirements\nis a part of responsible AI strategy for any institution.\nSFU Guidance\nAI systems must protect personal data and be built with strong safeguards against unauthorized access. Security ensures that information is handled responsibly throughout the system’s lifecycle and that robust security controls are in place to prevent abuse.\nUse only university-reviewed systems when entering personal information into AI tools, to ensure compliance with institutional privacy and security standards.\nConduct\nPrivacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)\nfor new AI solutions, and update PIAs if they have significantly changed.\nApply security safeguards proportional to\ndata sensitivity\n.\nWhile evaluating AI solutions, choose privacy-protective technologies.\nAccountable\nAccountable\nmeans that\norganizations and people remain responsible for the outcomes of AI systems\n. If an AI system causes harm or makes a mistake, there should be a clear path to address it and a person or team responsible for it. The idea is that AI should not be an excuse to “pass the buck” – those who use AI must ensure it is used correctly and take responsibility for its impacts.\nSFU Guidance\nOrganizations must remain answerable for how AI systems are developed and used. This includes ensuring decisions can be traced, data is used legally, and people—not machines—are ultimately responsible.\nYou remain accountable for content generated by AI solutions you use, including the impacts of its use elsewhere.\nResponses from AI generated content must not be treated as a source of authority.\nIf you are an SFU employee, do not use AI to collect personal information from public sources (such as websites, social media...etc.) except where specifically authorized and only after informing the individuals whose data is being collected.\nUnderstand that when AI generates information about a specific person—even if it's guessed or inferred—it still counts as personal data and must be handled according to privacy laws.\nEnsure that any personal information entered into AI systems is handled in accordance with the original Collection Notice and relevant privacy obligations, including the\nFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.\nor applicable university policies for your area.\nWhen considering AI solutions identify the impacts they could have on individuals or groups. Evaluate if it will be necessary for your purpose and not merely convenient.\nFair\nAI systems should\ntreat individuals and groups fairly\n, avoiding discrimination. This means the AI’s decisions or outputs should not be prejudiced against people on the basis of characteristics like race, gender, or other protected attributes. A known challenge is that AI models can inherit biases present in their training data.\nMitigating bias\nrequires careful data set curation and ongoing evaluation. Techniques include using diverse training data, testing outcomes for disparate impact and correcting any biased decision rules.\nSFU Guidance\nAI should treat individuals equitably and avoid bias in outcomes. Fairness means ensuring that no group is unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by automated decisions.\nEnsure the content you curate while using AI does not amplify biases or violate human rights, accessibility, or fairness obligations you have at the university.\nExplainable (Transparency)\nThere is a need for\ntransparency in how AI systems make decisions or produce outputs\n. For users and organizations to trust AI, they should be able to get some insight into what data was used and how the model works. This is difficult with complex models (the “black box” problem), but efforts like\nExplainable AI (XAI)\naim to provide human-understandable explanations for AI decisions.\nTransparency also involves being clear when content is generated or consumed by AI. Being transparent helps ensure accountability and allows individuals to contest or question an AI outcome.\nNOTE:\nSome AI solutions may not detail how an answer is being reached. As part of your question you can ask for an explanation to be included in the answer. For example, \"What is the best time to visit Vancouver?\nExplain your reasoning\n\".\nSFU Guidance\nTransparency in AI builds trust and enables scrutiny. Users must be able to understand how AI systems work, verify their outputs, and justify decisions informed by AI.\nYou are responsible for verifying responses provided by AI. If you are unable to verify and explain results, then consider not using them.\nYou remain responsible for the execution and transparency of decisions informed or made by AI Solutions.\nEnsure AI generated content doesn't falsely impersonate or misrepresent you, others, or any other additional commitments you have (such as copyrighted content).\nBe transparent when others are interacting with AI generated content created vs. human generated content.\nMark outputs with significant impact as AI-generated.\nClearly inform people when AI is used in decision-making, with recourse options available.\nAuditable(Safety & Reliability)\nAI should be\nreliable and safe\n, meaning it performs as intended under expected conditions and fails gracefully under unexpected conditions. For instance, if an AI system controls a vehicle or provides medical advice, it must undergo rigorous testing and auditing to handle edge cases and avoid dangerous failures.\nSafety also involves the AI\nnot causing harm\nthrough its output. In generative AI, safety can mean preventing the AI from generating violent or illegal instructions, hate speech, or disinformation.\nSFU Guidance\nAI systems must be regularly reviewed to ensure reliability and safety. Auditing allows issues to be identified early and supports responsible oversight and continuous improvement.\nIf you are using an AI solution, ensure results or content it generates adheres to legal commitments, code of ethics, or other responsibilities you have in your role at the university. It will be incumbent on you to audit your use of AI in a reliable and safe manner. AI itself cannot take responsibility.\nWhen developing and supporting AI solutions that will be used by others, understand your responsibility to maintain them in a reliable and safe manner. Establish regular audits and testing to ensure your AI solution does not cause harm (such as disinformation, hate speech, or violent/illegal instructions).\nRemain informed about the limitations of AI solutions you use and assess whether they are suitable for your use. AI systems can provide inaccurate results if they aren't built for your context.\nInclusive\nAI should be designed to\nempower as many people as possible and avoid marginalizing any group\n. This principle emphasizes user-centric design – making AI accessible and useful to people with diverse backgrounds and abilities. For example, inclusive AI might involve ensuring that a voice assistant works for different accents and speech patterns, or that generative AI tools are available in many languages. In the context of responsible AI, inclusivity overlaps with fairness, but also encourages broad stakeholder input when designing AI (so that many perspectives are considered).\nSFU Guidance\nAI systems should be designed to serve people of all backgrounds and abilities. Inclusivity means considering diverse needs to promote accessibility, representation, and equal participation.\nPrioritize AI solutions that are designed to be accessible and supportive of people with diverse abilities, ensuring everyone can use and benefit from them.\nAvoid AI marginalizing groups or individuals; ensure datasets and outputs reflect diversity and equity.",

This includes: ePortfolio, biography, inbox messages, profile files, profile photo, profile customizations and settings.\n2) DETERMINE IF YOUR COURSE IS APPROPRIATE FOR MIGRATING\nMigrate to Canvas Cloud\nDo Not Migrate (Move or Forget)\nCourses that contain content you wish to keep and reuse for a future iteration of the course\nCourses that are currently running and have an end date beyond January 2026\nCourses used only for storage, record keeping or backup\nCourses used for research or containing research data\nCourses that contain content you no longer need\nSandbox and test courses\nTip: Use\nMicrosoft 365 tools (OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams)\nfor stronger file protection and recovery than Canvas.\nNOTE\n: Provided above are some general guidelines. Instructors are the experts on what courses and course content they wish to maintain. If your course content is still needed and requires Canvas features, migrate the course to Canvas Cloud.\nNON-ACADEMIC COURSE MIGRATION\nIf your course is non-academic (training, orientation, activity-type course), visit\nHow to migrate a Non-Academic Course\nto help you better understand key considerations and potential impacts.\nHOW TO MIGRATE\nAs long as the course instructional content won't be changing (i.e., no newly created modules, assignments, pages, quizzes, etc.), you're free to migrate at any time. If you are teaching in Spring 2026, we recommend migrating your course early to ensure that you have sufficient time to complete 'next steps' before the launch in January 2026.\nIT Services has a\ncourse migration tool\nto support course migration, along with guides to support its use:\nSTEP 1.\nVisit the course migration tool at\nmigrate.its.sfu.ca\nor select the button. You may be asked to sign in with your\nSFU Computing ID\n.\nCOURSE MIGRATION TOOL\nSTEP 2.\nSelect the\nCanvas course\nyou wish to migrate to Canvas Cloud on the drop-down menu. If you don't see your course, try\nRefresh List\n.\nSTEP 3.\nSelect\nSubmit Query\n.\nSTEP 4.\nSelect\nConfirm\n.\nSTEP 5.\nThe tool will begin migrating your course behind the scenes. Migrating large courses may be delayed during peak times. You can choose to leave the page and return to the course migration tool at\nmigrate.its.sfu.ca\n.\nOnce the progress is complete,\na web link will be displayed\nthat directs you to the migrated course on Canvas Cloud. You can also find the migrated course under\nCourses > All Courses\nin Canvas Cloud.\nNOTES\nThe course migration tool will remain available for the foreseeable future (until Canvas On-Premise has been completely deprecated).\nThe course migration tool is accessible to any SFU user. However, courses will only appear in the tool if the user has an 'instructor' role to those courses.\nRecently created courses (or courses you've recently been given instructor role) may not appear immediately. Try selecting 'Refresh List' after a few minutes.\nWhen a course is migrated from Canvas On-Premise, it will remain as-is and continues to be accessible to you. 'Course migration' simply copies your course from Canvas On-Premise to Canvas Cloud using the built-in 'export' feature on Canvas.\nIt is possible for a course can be migrated multiple times and by multiple people if a course has more than one instructor. 'Course migration' simply creates a copy and assigns the user who initiated the migration access to the copied course.\nThis process bar should not take more than a few minutes to complete for smaller courses (less than 50 MB). Larger courses (over 500 MB) can possibly take 30 minutes or more during peak periods.\nFor technical support, request a support ticket using\nCanvas - Request Help\n. (Select '\n' as the area of help)\nNEXT STEPS\nAfter you have migrated your course:\nReview\nthe course for any issues and make necessary adjustments.\nIn rare cases, links to media files or third-party tools (LTIs) may not transfer correctly and may need to be manually updated.\nSome modules or pages may not retain its 'published/unpublished' state.\nCopy or import\nthe content from your migrated course to your official course shell. This allows you to adjust terms, dates and more on assignments and announcements.\nInstructors teaching in Spring 2026 can find their credit course shell on the\nCanvas Cloud Dashboard\nstarting September 2025. Credit course shells will now appear automatically on their Canvas Cloud Dashboard once assigned in goSFU — instructors don’t need to request one using the 'Start a New Course' tool. For details, see\nChanges to Credit Course Shell Creation\n.\nPlease note that students will be automatically added at the start of class in Spring 2026.\nExplore\nNew Quizzes.\nYou have the option to convert\nyour quizzes from\nClassic Quizzes to New Quizzes\n.\nPlease note that once a Classic Quiz converted to a New Quiz, it cannot be reverted.\nLearn more\nabout\nfeature differences between Canvas On-Premise and Canvas Cloud\n.\nNON-ACADEMIC COURSE MIGRATION\nIf you're migrating a course that is non-academic (training, orientation, activity-type course), visit\nHow to migrate a Non-Academic Course\nto help you better understand key considerations and potential impacts.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor questions about Canvas migration:\nVisit our\nCanvas Migration FAQs\n.\nFor pedagogical or instructional design questions:\nContact ceehelp@sfu.ca.\nFor additional assistance or technical support:\nRequest a support ticket using\nCanvas - Request Help\n.

You have the option to convert your quizzes from\nClassic Quizzes to New Quizzes\n.\nPlease note that once a Classic Quiz converted to a New Quiz, it cannot be reverted.\nRe-add users\n(students, instructors, designers) to your course.\nEnrolment-related data (i.e., roles, groups, etc.) are not transferred when migrating a course. For instructions on re-adding your students, visit\nHow to migrate Users to another course\n.\nIf you encounter an error, \"We were unable to find matches below\", simply select 'Next' to skip the user(s). Do not select any check boxes (refrain from creating them as new users). See\nHow to migrate Users to another course\nfor details on this error.\nConfiguring your course\nin such a way that students can continue progressing through the course without past student work (i.e., quiz submissions, assignments, discussion replies, etc.) since\nstudent work can't be migrated\n(if applicable to your course).\nFor example, you may want to remove module restrictions/prerequisites tied to assignments or quizzes if asking students to redo them is not an option.\nNotify your students in January 2026\non any important changes to the course (if applicable to your course).\nIf needed for your course, canvas-old.sfu.ca is available starting January 2026 to access past course content.\nLearn more\nabout\nfeature differences between Canvas On-Premise and Canvas Cloud\n.\nCOURSES USING MAILLISTS FOR AUTOMATIC ENROLMENTS (MAILLIST INTEGRATION)\nAs of April 30, 2025,\nSFU Maillist has been transitioned to SFU Groups\n. If you are migrating a course that has automatic enrolments via maillists and would like to continue using this feature, you will need to\nrequest an SFU Groups security group\nas a replacement for the maillist.\nOnce you have a security group, request a support ticket using\nCanvas - Request Help\nfor us to connect that security group to your course on Canvas Cloud.\nNote: Grouper integration with Canvas Cloud will be available late Fall 2025. We suggest you prepare a security group ahead of time.\nEXCEPTIONS FOR COURSE CONTINUITY ON CANVAS ON-PREMISE\nDue to technical limitations with Canvas,\nstudent work\ntied to a course cannot be transferred to Canvas Cloud using the course migration tool. These components include:\nAssignment submissions\nQuiz submissions and results\nDiscussion replies\nIf existing\nstudent work\nis critical to the delivery of your non-academic course and cannot be moved over manually, it may be more appropriate to continue running the course on Canvas On-Premise until its conclusion.\nWe advise against this approach as it may cause unnecessary disruption for students who would need to navigate between two separate Canvas platforms.\nExamples where this option may be considered can be a course with:\nA large number of students have already submitted assignments or quizzes which are linked with unlocking modules and altering this is not an option.\nA large number of students have already submitted assignments or quizzes which continually need to be used throughout the course delivery\nA large number of posted discussions and replies that are critical to continuing the course delivery and manually copying these over to a new course shell is not feasible.\nTHIS APPLIES TO MY COURSE. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW?\nIf you choose to continue delivering the non-academic course on Canvas On-Premise, you should know the following:\nPlatform Transition Impacts\nStarting January 2026, the web link, canvas.sfu.ca, will redirect to Canvas Cloud. To access Canvas On-Premise, users must use the updated web link: canvas-old.sfu.ca.\nService Reduction\nIn 2026, Canvas On-Premise will be scaled back and run at a lower capacity as most usage will have moved to Canvas Cloud. Due to software licensing changes, there will also be recurring service outages in order to apply updates and security fixes.\nStudent Communication Required\nYou’ll need to proactively inform students of your decision to remain on Canvas On-Premise, only particular to your course. You will also need to inform students of the updated web link. Clear communication will help minimize confusion and ensure continued access to course materials.\nCourse End Date\nCourses that choose to continue on Canvas On-Premise must be concluded before the end of December 2026. After this date, access to this platform should only be for temporary archival purposes.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor questions about Canvas migration:\nVisit our\nCanvas Migration FAQs\n.\nFor pedagogical or instructional design questions:\nContact ceehelp@sfu.ca.\nFor additional assistance or technical support:\nRequest a support ticket using\nCanvas - Request Help\n.

    "clean_body_text": "Teaching and Learning\nLearning Management\nCanvas\nOVERVIEW\nThis article describes the changes to credit course shell creation on Canvas Cloud as part of the\ntransition to Canvas Cloud\n.\nWHAT'S HAPPENING?\nBEFORE IN CANVAS ON-PREMISE\nNOW IN CANVAS CLOUD\nBY REQUEST\nInstructors would've needed to request the course shell themselves using the\nStart a New Course\ntool. Once requested, it will be created and available to the instructor.\nFor some departments, staff would've requested these courses on behalf of instructors to assist with the course setup or on-boarding.\nIn some cases, instructors cannot request their course shell because it was already requested/claimed by another individual. The instructor would've needed to contact IT Services to reclaim it.\nCROSS-LISTING\nInstructors can choose to cross-list their courses using the\nStart a New Course\ntool if their courses haven't already been requested/claimed.\nAlternatively, instructors can contact IT Services to cross-list their course.\nAUTOMATIC\nCredit course shells no longer need to be requested. Credit course shells will automatically appear on the Canvas Dashboard for instructors\none semester\nprior to the start of class.\nFor example, if an instructor is assigned to teach a course in Spring 2026, their course shell will be automatically be created and assigned to them at the beginning of September 2025.\nBY REQUEST\nThe\nStart a New Course\ntool remains available along with all of its features.\nFor departments who requested courses on behalf of instructors, they may continue to request course shells ahead of time to assist instructors.\nAs before, course shells can be requested\ntwo semesters\nprior to the start of class.\nCROSS-LISTING\nThe process for cross-listing remains mostly unchanged. Instructors can continue to cross-list their courses using the\nStart a New Course\ntool if their courses haven't already been requested/claimed.\nBecause of the automatic course creation, we recommend creating cross-listings with the\nStart a New Course\ntool before\none semester\nprior to the start of class if possible.\nIf their course shells have already been created by the automatic course shell process, instructors can contact IT Services to cross-list their course.\nTECHNICAL DETAILS ON THE AUTOMATIC COURSE SHELL CREATION\nSTUDENT ENROLMENT\nFor Spring 2026 credit course shells: students will be automatically added at the start of class (January 2026).\nFor Summer 2026 and future credit course shells: students will be automatically added within 24 hours of creation.\nBEHIND THE SCENES\nCanvas Cloud automatically creates and assigns course shells to instructors based on goSFU as long as an instructor has been assigned to teach a course by departmental staff. This happens to courses one semester prior to the start of the course. The system runs this creation process for Canvas Cloud once a day.\nWHEN NO INSTRUCTOR IS ASSIGNED\nIf no specific instructor (or a placeholder) has been assigned to a course on goSFU, the automatic course creation will not happen to those courses until one is assigned.\nWHEN THE INSTRUCTOR CHANGES\nAssuming that course shell has already been automatically created and a new instructor is assigned in goSFU, when the system find that the user with the instructor role on the course shell is different from the assigned instructor on goSFU, the system will automatically add the new instructor. Any existing users with the instructor role in that course shell will not be removed when the instructor is assigned.\nWHEN THE COURSE SHELL ALREADY EXISTS\nIf a course shell has already been requested (and created) via the\nStart a New Course\ntool, when the Automatic Course Shell Creation starts at the beginning of the semester, the system will look at goSFU data and check if the assigned instructor has already been added to the course shell. If the instructor is not in the course shell, the system will automatically add the instructor to the existing course shell and will appear on their dashboard. Any existing users with the instructor role in that course shell will not be removed when the instructor is assigned.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor questions about Canvas migration:\nVisit our\nCanvas Migration FAQs\n.\nFor pedagogical or instructional design questions:\nContact ceehelp@sfu.ca.\nFor additional assistance or technical support:\nRequest a support ticket using\nCanvas - Request Help\n.

In such cases, contact\nprivacy@sfu.ca\n.\nTo request a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for an AI-enabled tool, please see the overview and forms here:\nPrivacy Impact Assessments\nConcerns and considerations when using AI applications that do not have an SFU PIA\nWhen using an AI application that does not have an SFU PIA as indicated in the above table, always keep in mind these six considerations:\nUnauthorized data collection\nBC’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) strictly prohibits unauthorized collection, use and disclosure of Personal information. The scope of “Personal information” is fairly broad, and includes information such as name, image, marital or family status, unique identifying numbers, demographic information (gender, race, ethnicity, religion), educational history, employment history and job performance, personal contact information, financial history, medical history, disability status, an individual's recorded personal views or opinions, and anyone else's recorded views and opinions about an individual. The ease of accidentally using or disclosing personal data is a significant concern, especially if the data is used for purposes beyond what the user initially agreed to at the original point of collection, such as unwanted targeted advertising or profile generation.\nSurveillance and tracking\nAI applications can be used for monitoring individuals online and in the physical world, raising significant concerns about mass surveillance and loss of privacy. Data that you enter into GenAI-enabled software applications can be used to deliver highly targeted advertisements, influence decision-making (e.g., what content you see), or even predict future behaviour. In some cases, this tracking extends beyond the application itself, following users across websites and devices using tracking pixels, cookies, and device fingerprints.\nData breaches and leaks\nAI systems often store and analyze large datasets. Therefore, they are attractive targets for hackers and cybercriminals. If an AI system containing medical, educational, or financial information is breached, Personal or Confidential information could be exposed. This threatens individual privacy and can lead to identity theft and financial fraud. Report such breaches to Information Security Services via\nSFU ServiceHub\nand the\nPrivacy Management Program\n.\nAutomated decision-making and loss of human oversight\nAI can improve efficiency and decision-making, but excessive reliance on AI without human oversight can have serious consequences. AI can potentially be used to support business activities such as hiring employees, or assessing student university admissions, by making decisions based on data patterns. However, these decisions may lack transparency, making it difficult for individuals to understand the outcome or question the results of the analyses, or to recognize any biases that may have influenced the decision. This leads to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly if AI is trained on biased data. If you are going to use AI to make a decision, you need to be prepared to defend the decision and the decision-making process.\nThreats to Information Security\nEnsure the use of generative AI complies with other SFU Policies such as\nInformation Systems Policy GP24: Acceptable Use and Security of Digital Information and Electronic Systems\n, including the\nInformation Security Standards\n. To keep SFU’s electronic information secure, anyone doing university work on non-SFU systems must follow the Privacy and Information Security Standards and Procedures. Generative AI could be used in harmful ways, and there is a real risk of more cyber and fraud attacks — like deepfakes used by attackers to trick or target people.\nCopyright infringement\nGenAI applications may use content provided to them as training data to further refine their performance. You should be aware that uploading or pasting parts, or all, of a document into this type of GenAI application may violate copyright. Also remember that even if you or SFU owns the copyright to a document, always check that it does not contain Personal or Confidential information as outlined above. Additionally, many third party copyrighted works are made available to SFU users under license. In many cases these licenses prohibit the use of the content with GenAI applications, so always check the license terms for this content before using them with GenAI applications.\nSubject-specific contacts\nPrivacy Queries can be sent to\nprivacy@sfu.ca\n.\nInformation Security Queries can be sent to\ninformation-security@sfu.ca\n.\nRisk Queries can be sent to\nrisk_srs@sfu.ca\n.\nCopyright Queries can be sent to\ncopy@sfu.ca\n.\nDefinitions\nPersonal Information\n: recorded data about an identifiable individual other than business contact information. Examples include name, image, marital or family status, unique identifying numbers, demographic information (gender, race, ethnicity, religion), educational history, employment history and job performance, personal contact information, financial history, medical history, disability status, an individual's recorded personal views or opinions, and anyone else's recorded views and opinions about an individual.\nConfidential information\n: includes trade secrets and proprietary data.\nRelated Articles (2)\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot\nLearn more about Microsoft 365 Copilot (a personalized productivity AI assistant) at SFU.\nPrivacy and Security Guidance for using Microsoft 365 Copilot\nLearn about privacy and security guidance for using Copilot at SFU.",

    "clean_body_text": "Overview\nThis article is related to the privacy and security policies of Zoom.\nDetails\nLast updated March 15, 2022\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY WITH ZOOM\nSFU is prioritizing the security and privacy of all faculty, staff and students while configuring Zoom's system-wide settings, which will be more restrictive to start. As conversations progress and SFU continues adjusting to adopt recommended practices to balance risk mitigation with meeting community needs, changes may occur to the availability of features and functions. Updates will be published on this page as new details are confirmed.\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\nWith the recent transition to work-from-home environments for many SFU faculty, staff, and students, please be mindful of the type of content being shared, which is now more likely to include personal environments. Participants have the option of either turning off their camera or using a virtual background to hide their personal environment.\nAnyone recording sessions in SFU Zoom is required to meet our privacy obligations under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). We advise against recording sessions using third-party applications or non-SFU Zoom accounts without attendees’ knowledge and/or consent.\nAll recorded content may be subject to a formal access to information request made under FIPPA.\nFor added security, you can configure your meetings to allow only users with Zoom accounts to join your meetings.\nCheck out the instructions\n.\nPROVIDING CONSENT TO TERMS OF USE\nYour participation in a Zoom meeting will result in the disclosure of personal information to Zoom Video Communications. You may consent to this disclosure in one of two ways:\nIf you are an SFU student, staff or faculty member, by signing into your\nSFU Zoom account\n, you have provided consent as part of the sign-in process.\nIf you are a meeting/webinar participant without an SFU Zoom account, you can consent by filling out this form:\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/zoomprivacy\nRECORDING MEETINGS IN ZOOM\nPRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS FOR RECORDING\nNotable requirements for compliance with FIPPA include:\nSecuring stored recordings. Avoid storing records on non-SFU systems (e.g., Google Drive or Dropbox). Consider filing recordings with other related departmental records; do not leave recordings on personal devices.\nOn January 12th, 2021, SFU Zoom offers optional cloud recording for hosts of all Zoom meetings. All Cloud recordings are stored in SFU Zoom’s new online Canadian data centre. Passcode protection is enforced for all shared cloud recordings. Cloud recordings stored in the Zoom cloud will be deleted 365 days after the meeting date or can be deleted by the host. Local and cloud recording allows the host to record their Zoom meeting's video, audio, transcribed text, and chat transcripts.\nA properly formatted collection notice that clearly defines the business purpose for the collection of personal information, the legal authority for the collection, and the contact information of an SFU officer or employee who can answer questions regarding collection. Zoom does not have any built-in capability of delivering such a collection notice.\nControlled access. Access to recordings can only be granted to university employees when it is necessary for the performance of their work duties. Sharing of the recordings in the absence of a legitimate business need is not authorized.\nConsistent use. Participants’ personal information can only be used for the purpose for which it was obtained and compiled or for a use consistent with that purpose. Secondary uses of the recordings are not authorized.\nMinimum retention. Recordings containing personal information must be retained for a minimum of one year if they are used to make decisions that directly affect participants. Examples include academic advising sessions, job interviews and exam invigilations.\nAuthorized disposal. The University will dispose of recordings only with an approved Records Retention Schedule and Disposal Authority. Departments may or may not have applicable RRSDAs already in place. Visit the\nDirectory of University Records\nfor more information at\nhttps://www.sfu.ca/archives2/dur/dur.html\n.\nA business rationale for the need to record content. Staff meetings, academic advising sessions, job interviews, etc. have not been typically recorded at the University in the past. We strongly advise against recording Zoom sessions for the purposes of administrate convenience or as a means of compiling meeting minutes and notes.\nRECORDING ZOOM LECTURES: PRIVACY AND COPYRIGHT GUIDELINES FOR INSTRUCTORS\nCOLLECTION\nDepending on how you run your lectures and the steps students take to anonymize their identities, it is possible that a student's personal information (e.g., name, image, voice, personal views and opinions, course work) may be captured in a recording. Use a collection notice so that your students are aware of the purpose for the collection of their personal information, the legal authority for the collection, and to whom they can direct questions about the collection. The following is a recommended template:\n...More →\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n1. CAN I RECORD A LECTURE THAT I AM DELIVERING?\nSee\nPrivacy and Copyright Guidelines for Instructors for Recording Zoom Lectures\nfor measures to take when recording lectures.\n2. CAN I RECORD A STAFF MEETING?\nStaff should not record meetings, especially if individual third parties will be discussed (e.g. job candidates, students, members of the public, etc.). If you must record a meeting then you should refrain from disclosing personal details about yourself or third parties. If you need to discuss specific third parties, anonymize the individuals by using pseudonyms (e.g. Applicant 1, Applicant 2, Applicant 3).\n3. CAN I RECORD A MEETING WITH A STUDENT OR OTHER PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL?\nWhen meeting virtually with students or other private individuals using Zoom, you need to inform the individual about how they can anonymize their identity. In addition, we strongly recommend that counsellors, doctors, advisors, and others who are discussing sensitive personal information (e.g., medical history, academic history, disability accommodations, financial history) do not use Zoom's recording feature. Meeting hosts are responsible for notifying participants if they are recording a meeting. Meeting participants will generally hear a notice or see an on-screen notification when recording is in progress\n4. HOW DO I ANONYMIZE MY IDENTITY WHEN ATTENDING A ZOOM SESSION?\nIf you have been invited to a Zoom meeting as an attendee, you can join the Zoom meeting via the\nweb application\nwithout signing into a Zoom account. The Zoom web application allows you to use a pseudonym (e.g. first name only or a nickname).\nIf you prefer to use your SFU Zoom account to participate in sessions, you can change your display name before joining the session. Please note that you will have to make this change every time you sign into\nSFU Zoom\n, as your display name will revert to your first and last name with every login.\nYou can anonymize yourself further by not using the audio and video conferencing features, and by not revealing any personal information about yourself or third parties during online discussions.\n5. CAN I CHANGE MY DISPLAY NAME?\nYou can change your display name before joining the session or change a\npreferred name\nin your profile.\nOverview\nThis article is related to the privacy and security policies of Zoom.\nOverview\nThis article is related to the privacy and security policies of Zoom.\nOverview\nThis article is related to the privacy and security policies of Zoom.",

    "clean_body_text": "Information Security\nIdentity and Access Management\nCentral Authentication Service (CAS)\nOVERVIEW\nBefore SFU adopted CAS as its authentication method for the web, we already had an Apache authentication/authorization module that allowed limited access control based on maillist membership. With the arrival of CAS, we modified a version of mod_cas (later mod_auth_cas) that would allow Apache to use the SFU version of CAS version 2 (later CAS version 3) to grant access based on SFU maillists.\nDETAILS\nWith the arrival of CAS 5, the changes made to CAS by SFU are no longer needed, and the latest unchanged version of mod_auth_cas can be used. This version supports Apache 2.4 (which the older SFU modified version of mod_auth_cas does not). Because the 2.2 version of Apache is no longer being maintained by The Apache Software Foundation, you may want to upgrade your Apache, but that will also require that you upgrade to the latest version of mod_auth_cas.\nCAN WE CONTINUE TO USE THE OLDER VERSION OF MOD_AUTH_CAS?\nThe short answer is yes. However, that version of mod_auth_cas does not support Apache 2.4, so you are stuck with the older non-maintained version of Apache. There are a few other things to keep in mind if you want to continue using the old SFU version of mod_auth_cas.\nFor example, in order to do the authorization, the SFU modified mod_auth_cas uses an SFU added feature of CAS, and adds an \"allow=\" string to the login and serviceValidate CAS entry points. We have added support for this to CAS 5 to continue to support the old mod_auth_cas, but this may not be supported in future upgrades to CAS.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that mod_auth_cas needs attributes from CAS to do the authorization work. The older versions of CAS didn't return attributes, so SFU modified CAS so that you could get the needed attributes from serviceValidate. In CAS 5, attributes are returned using p3/serviceValidate, but not with serviceValidate. We have added a setting in CAS 5 to allow some attributes to be returned by serviceValidate, and this setting will be set for those services that were using the old SFU mod_auth_cas before the upgrade to CAS 5. If you want to use the old SFU mod_auth_cas with a new service, you either need to let us know to set that setting for your service, or you need to specify \"CASValidateURL https://cas.sfu.ca/cas/p3/serviceValidate\" to get the attributes that are needed by mod_auth_cas.\nWHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO UPGRADE TO THE NEW MOD_AUTH_CAS?\nThere are a number of good reasons to upgrade to the new mod_auth_cas, including allowing you to upgrade to the new, fully supported, Apache 2.4. The first thing to do before upgrading is to read\nUsing mod_auth_cas at SFU\nto get an idea how the new module works and where to get it.\nOnce you have the new mod_auth_cas downloaded, built and installed, you need to make sure that you have set CASValidateURL to p3/serviceValidate like this:\nCASValidateURL https://cas.sfu.ca/cas/p3/serviceValidate\nThe next step is to check if you have specified\nAuthtype Basic\nwhen using mod_auth_cas. This was allowed in the old SFU mod_auth_cas so that you could use Apache basic authentication in conjunction with CAS when controlling access to a non-web application such as WebDAV. This is not supported in the new mod_auth_cas, but we have made available a simple authentication module mod_authn_cas which will handle this use case.\nSee this page for information on mod_authn_cas\n.\nUsing \"Basic\" was also allowed in certain circumstances as equivalent to \"CAS\". If that was how it was being used, simply use \"Authtype CAS\" instead.\nNext, check to see if you use\nAuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd\nto point to a file containing userid/password entries. The old mod_auth_cas would let you use these .htpasswd files to specify IDs or maillists to control access. The new mod_auth_cas doesn't support these .htpasswd files, so see the following table for replacing items in the .htpasswd file with Require lines.\nLine in .htpasswd file\nWhat it did\nEquivalent Require line in new mod_auth_cas\n+userid\nallow access to SFU userid\nRequire user userid\n+!mail-list\nallow access to members of mail-list\nRequire cas-attribute member:resource:dept:DEPT_NAME:some-group\nuserid password\nallow access to made up ID\nthis is not supported in new mod_auth_cas\nThe final step is to replace the Require directives from the old mod_auth_cas with equivalent Require directives for the new mod_auth_cas.

    "clean_body_text": "Information Security\nIdentity and Access Management\nCentral Authentication Service (CAS)\nOVERVIEW\nWHAT IS CAS\nThe Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a web application used by other web applications to authenticate visitors. In addition to providing authentication, CAS implements a\nsingle sign-on\nfeature to make it easier for users to move from one authenticated application to another. SFU CAS is a slightly modified version of\nJasig CAS\n. SFU has added a number of extensions to CAS (mostly authorization features such as integration with our mail list system), but has maintained compatibility with Jasig CAS, so applications that support Jasig CAS should work at SFU without modification.\nWHEN TO USE CAS\nAny application in use at SFU, whether running on the cgi.sfu.ca server, or running on a departmental or dedicated server, can use CAS for authentication. Third-party applications customized for SFU should be modified to use CAS whenever possible.\nAlthough CAS can provide some basic\nauthorization\n, it is an\nauthentication\nservice. It determines that users are who they say they are. CAS can provide information to help an application make\nauthorization\ndecisions, but it is important to understand that some people who possess an SFU computing account may only be loosely affiliated with SFU.\nAll applications that use SFU CAS must be registered as a service. Fill out the\nCAS Service Application form\nto get started\n.\nDETAILS\nTHE EASIEST WAY TO USE CAS\nIn many cases, using CAS requires no new programming to protect either static web content or dynamic web applications. On systems that run the Apache HTTP Server, a runtime module (\nmod_auth_cas\n) is available to provide CAS authentication to the entire server (or a configurable subset of the server’s content).\nWhile CAS simply authenticates users, this module provides both authentication services and access-control services. It lets you grant access to specific users as well as users based on their membership in a maillist. It even lets users on your servers authenticate users and restrict access via local .htaccess files.\nA PROGRAMMER’S VIEW OF CAS\nIf you decide that the Apache module is insufficient for your needs, you will need to write a small amount of custom code to handle authentication programmatically. Some client libraries are available to ease the use of CAS even further.\nBefore you begin to integrate your application with CAS, however, you should understand a few details about the way CAS operates. First and more importantly, CAS is unlike many familiar authentication systems because it is not simply a password-validation tool. In a traditional environment, your web application will ask users for an ID and a password, and it will then call logic to determine whether this ID/password pair is valid. With CAS, however, your application never gains access to the user's password; to improve system-wide security, users supply their passwords only to the CAS server directly.\nTherefore, using CAS in your application may be more circuitous than you initially imagine, though be assured that the process is still straightforward and easy to master. When you first encounter a new user (e.g., one that has not yet established a session with your application), you'd normally display a username/password form in HTML. With CAS, you don't do this; instead, you simply redirect the user's browser to CAS's login URL, which is\nhttps://cas.sfu.ca/cas/login\nCAS then authenticates the user. If authentication fails – e.g., if the user cannot supply a correct password – then you’ll never hear from the user again. Instead, the user will remain at CAS’s site and will have the option to choose various “help” links that point to IT Services help sites to help them deal with computing account problems.\nOnly if a user successfully authenticates does that user’s browser return to your application. Specifically, the user returns because CAS redirects the browser back to your application. CAS knows how to find your application because when you initially redirected the user to CAS, you supplied a service parameter, in the form\nhttps://cas.sfu.ca/cas/login?service=http://my/url\n(Note that any metacharacters in your service URL, such as question marks, ampersands, and equals signs, must be escaped appropriately using the standard URL encoding algorithm: %26 for &, %3D for =, and %3F for ?. This will be necessary if your service URL contains parameters of its own. Note also that while it is necessary that you use HTTPS to safeguard your own application's authentication in secure environments, CAS's overall security is not weakened if your application merely uses HTTP; instead, CAS still authenticates the user securely.)\nWhen CAS redirects the authenticated user back to your application, it will append a parameter named ticket to your URL. For instance, the URL you supplied CAS may be called as follows:\nhttp://my/url?ticket=ST-92834-m34Aa83f7a3f\nWe call this ticket\nopaque\nbecause, unlike an X.509 certificate or a Kerberos TGT, it is not possible for your application to decipher its meaning in isolation or from first principles. It has no internal structure useful to your application. The only thing you can do with this ticket is to send it back to CAS, which involves opening an HTTPS connection to\nhttps://cas.sfu.ca/cas/serviceValidate\nand sending two query parameters: service, which must match the service URL you initially supplied to CAS when redirecting the user there, and ticket, which is the ticket you just received. CAS then responds either with an explicit refutation of the ticket (think “it’s not meaningful to me and does not represent a valid user”) or an acknowledgment that the ticket proves authentication. In the latter case, CAS also supplies information about the user in an XML document, most notably the account that the user logged in with.\nNote that this final connection to CAS occurs directly between your application and CAS; your application opens a socket connection and retrieves information from the CAS server. You do not redirect the browser; you speak directly to CAS, effectively closing the loop and completing the authentication process. The CAS client libraries focus on making the HTTPS communication simple in a variety of languages; you don’t need to know details about how to write an SSL or HTTPS client, nor do you need to know any details about how CAS’s response is formatted textually.\nWHAT TO DO ONCE YOU AUTHENTICATE A USER WITH CAS\nCAS is not a session-management mechanism; it provides no facility for helping you keep track of users once they’re authenticated. Typically, applications will want to track users just as they would if they’d validated a user’s password themselves. That is, you’ll probably want to establish your own session – using application-specific, in-memory cookies or a similar mechanism – right after you validate a user’s authenticity with CAS.\nCAS is a single sign-on facility; once a user authenticates to CAS, the user need not continue to supply a password for other applications that redirect the user to CAS. However, CAS is\nnot\na “single sign-off” facility; a user that logs out of CAS will still have access to your application if your application keeps a persistent session with the user. CAS does offer a Single Sign Out option, which, when activated, will notify an application that a user has logged out of CAS. The application can then terminate any remaining local sessions as well. See the Jasig documentation for more details.\nCAS does provide a “logout” URL that the user may visit; loading the URL causes CAS to forget about the user’s prior authentication. Applications may link to this URL at\nhttps://cas.sfu.ca/cas/logout\nOTHER THINGS CAS CAN DO\nCAS lets applications opt out of its single sign-on facility. For applications that consider their data especially sensitive, this facility may be appropriate to ensure that a CAS-authenticated user is still present and hasn’t, for instance, walked away from a public kiosk. Note that using this feature makes it difficult to integrate your application into a campus-wide portal and may disappoint users’ expectations of single sign on. To use this option, you would add the parameter\nrenew=true\nto the login and serviceValidate URLs.\nCAS also lets applications choose to not force a user to log in if they are not already logged in. This will guarantee that the user will not be interrupted by a login page, and allow the application to put up a generic (or gateway) page if the user is not currently logged in. This option is chosen by adding the parameter\ngateway=true\nto the login URL.\nOTHER CAS OPTIONS\nCAS offers some other options to allow applications to modify how they interact with CAS. The following options are extensions added to the SFU version of CAS, and are not available in the Jasig version of CAS.\nThese options are:\nerror=error+message – If the application has determined that the user who has been successfully authenticated does not have access to the application, it can redirect to the login page again, this time using the renew=true option along with the error option to explain to the user why they need to try another user account.\nmessage=message+from+application – The application can choose to put a message to the user up on the login page. If this is not set, CAS will put a default \"You have requested access to a site that requires authentication\" message\napp=AppName – The application can specify its name so that CAS can put up a more specific \"Login required\" message.\nallow=handler1,handler2,… – CAS can use one or more “handlers” to authenticate a user. Each of the specified handlers will be tried in turn until it can be determined that the authentication has succeeded or failed. By default, the sfuhandler alone is used. If this option is used, it must be passed to both the login and serviceValidate URLs.\nThe handlers that are available are:\n1.\nsfu\n– This is the default (i.e. if no allow list is given), and will match any SFU account. The serviceValidate call-back, will return a response like the following:\n<cas:serviceResponse>\n<cas:authenticationSuccess>\n<cas:user>userID</cas:user>\n<cas:authtype>sfu</cas:authtype>\n</cas:authenticationSuccess>\n</cas:serviceResponse>\n2.\nalumni\n– This will match any alumni email address and password. The user must enter id@alumni.sfu.ca and their password. The following will be returned from the serviceValidate call-back:\n<cas:serviceResponse>\n<cas:authenticationSuccess>\n<cas:user>userID@alumni.sfu.ca</cas:user>\n<cas:authtype>alumni</cas:authtype>\n</cas:authenticationSuccess>\n</cas:serviceResponse>\n3. staff\n4. faculty\n5. student\n6. sponsored\n7.\napache\n- This was added to CAS to allow the Apache CAS module to authenticate accounts from a .htpasswd file serviceValidate call-back for this option:\nSome people have found it useful to use this from an application calling CAS directly to implement their own \"accounts\". Because CAS can't do the authentication for you, the password will be returned to your application. Because a password will be returned to you, CAS will not allow you to have an \"apache\" account that has the same id and password as an SFU account. The following would be returned from the\n<cas:serviceResponse>\n<cas:authenticationSuccess>\n<cas:user>id</cas:user>\n<cas:authtype>apache</cas:authtype>\n<cas:password>password</cas:password>\n</cas:authenticationSuccess>\n</cas:serviceResponse>\n9.\n!mail-list\n- This allows access to members of a mail list. You specify an allow option with an exclamation mark followed by the mail list name. If you use the parameter:\nallow=!sfu-cas\nthe following would be returned from the serviceValidate call-back if a member of that mail list logged in:\n<cas:serviceResponse>\n<cas:authenticationSuccess>\n<cas:user>ray</cas:user>\n<cas:authtype>sfu</cas:authtype>\n<cas:maillist>sfu-cas</cas:maillist>\n</cas:authenticationSuccess>\n</cas:serviceResponse>\nWhat Gets Passed Back By serviceValidate\nThe serviceValidate URL will pass back an XML document indicating the success or failure of the validation. On failure, an error like the following will be returned:\n<cas:serviceResponse>\n<cas:authenticationFailure code='\n...\n'>\nOptional authentication failure message\n</cas:authenticationFailure>\n</cas:serviceResponse>\nindicating that the ticket was invalid and why, or:\n<cas:serviceResponse>\n<cas:authenticationSuccess>\n<cas:user>\nuserID\n</cas:user>\n<cas:authtype>sfu</cas:authtype>\n</cas:authenticationSuccess>\n</cas:serviceResponse>\nindicating that the validation succeeded. The number and types of keyword/value pairs varies depending on the application. The user and authtype keywords are always returned. Other items may be returned (e.g., see the allow option above).\nPROXY AUTHENTICATION\nIn a multi-tier CAS installation, an agent acting on behalf of a user, but without direct access to the user's cookie cache, may need to convince a third party that it represents the user legitimately. For example, a WebMail application that connects to a POP server to collect the user’s email, would have to convince the POP server that it is acting legitimately on behalf of a particular user. Using proxy tickets, a back-end service may determine (a) what user is being impersonated; (b) who is handling the impersonation. These two determinations allow service to accept proxied credentials selectively.\nTHE PLAYERS\nA few definitions are in order:\nCAS\nThe Central Authentication Service: a trusted arbiter of authenticity.\nService\nA web application that authenticates users via CAS.\nProxy\nA service that wants to impersonate users to other services.\nTarget\n(or\nback-end service\n)\nA service that accepts impersonated (proxied) credentials from at least one particular proxy.\nTICKETS\nParties involved in a CAS authentication make use of\ntickets\n, or opaque strings that prove some assertion to CAS. CAS uses the following tickets:\nTicket-granting cookie (TGC)\nA ticket encapulated by a cookie that is sent to the user's web browser and returned only to CAS, and only over a secured channel. This ticket establishes the user's identity with CAS and lets CAS act as a single sign-on system for the web.\nService ticket (ST)\nA ticket sent by CAS, through the user's browser, to a service. Each ST may be used only once, and must be combined with the unique identifier for one specific service in order to be useful. (Put another way, a service that knows its own unique identifier will refuse to accept STs intended for another service. This prevents one service from mounting a \"man in the middle\" attack against another.)\nProxy-granting ticket (PGT)\nA ticket sent by CAS to a service holding a valid ST (but see below). This ticket (associated with an individual service and an individual user) confers the ability to produce proxy tickets (see below).\nProxy-granting ticket IOU (PGTIOU)\nA ticket sent by CAS alone in a service validation response, and with a PGT to the callback URL. It is the web application's responsibility to maintain a table to correlate PGTIOUs and PGTs (see below).\nProxy ticket (PT)\nA ticket usable by a\nproxy\nto access a\ntarget\nby impersonating a single user. The\nPT\ncarries information about the proxy or proxies attempting to gain access. For targets that are also (second- or higher-level proxies), a\nPT\nmay be used to obtain a\nPGT\n, but this\nPGT\nwill preserve information about the linear series of proxies that lie between the user and the ultimate target.\nPROXY MECHANISM\nIf an application that is using CAS needs to be a\nproxy\n, and so needs a\nproxy ticket\nto pass on to a\ntarget\napplication, the\nproxy\napplicationserviceValidate URL, The needs to pass an extra query parameter to the proxyCallbackUrl parameter is used to specify a URL that CAS will connect to with two query parameters:\npgtID\n– the actual value representing the\nPGT\n.\npgtIou\n- the PGTIOU contained in CAS's response to the web application's request.\nYour application has the responsibility to maintain a table to correlate PGTIOUs and PGTs. The CAS servicevalidate callback will then respond with the following:\n<cas:serviceResponse>\n<cas:authenticationSuccess>\n<cas:user>\nuserID\n</cas:user>\n<cas:authtype>sfu</cas:authtype>\n<cas:proxyGrantingTicket>\nPGTIOU\n</cas:proxyGrantingTicket>\n</cas:authenticationSuccess>\n</cas:serviceResponse>\nYour application can now match the\nPGTIOU\nto get the\nPGT\nfrom the table that was setup by your applications proxyCallbackUrl.\nThe\nproxy\napplication can now obtain proxy tickets (\nPT\ns) by using the following request/response connection:\nRequest:\nThe\nproxy\napplication sends an HTTP request with two query parameters: pgt and targetService, representing respectively a\nPGT\nand the unique identifier (URL) corresponding to the\ntarget\napplication to which the\nproxy\napplication wishes to gain access. The URL to send the request to is:\nhttps://cas.sfu.ca/cas/proxy\nResponse:\nA cas:proxyFailure message can be returned here for invalid or expired PGTs. On success, a message, of the following format, is sent by CAS to the application:\n<cas:serviceResponse>\n<cas:proxySuccess>\n<cas:proxyTicket>\nPT\n</cas:proxyTicket>\n</cas:proxySuccess>\n</cas:serviceResponse>\nThis\nPT\nmay then be sent by the application to the\ntarget\nservice, which validates it with CAS using the following protocol:\nRequest:\nThe\ntarget\napplication sends an HTTP request with two query parameters: ticket and service, representing respectively the\nPT\nand the unique identifier (URL) of the\ntarget\napplication. The URL to send the request to is:\nhttps://cas.sfu.ca/cas/proxyValidate\nResponse:\nA cas:authenticationFailure message can be returned here for invalid or expired PTs. On success, a message, of the following format, is sent by CAS to the application:\n<cas:serviceResponse>\n<cas:authenticationSuccess>\n<cas:user>\nuserID\n</cas:user>\n<cas:authtype>sfu</cas:authtype>\n<cas:proxyGrantingTicket>\nPGTIOU\n</cas:proxyGrantingTicket>\n<cas:proxies>\n<cas:proxy>\nproxy1\n</cas:proxy>\n<cas:proxy>\nproxy2\n</cas:proxy>\n<cas:proxy>\nproxy3\n</cas:proxy>\n...\n</cas:proxies>\n</cas:authenticationSuccess>\n</cas:serviceResponse>\nThe target service may then make any access-control decisions it needs to make, based both on the username and on the proxy “path” conveyed by the response from CAS.\nAs the general format of this latest response message suggests, proxies may be \"chained\" – that is, applied successively – before an ultimate target is reached. This chaining is achieved by the added PGTIOU to this recent message – when target services implement the \"proxy granting\" protocol. Thus, a target service may act as a proxy as well.\nCalls to proxyValidate can also specify allow options. The default allow option is sfu, so if this option is not specified, only SFU accounts will be returned to the application.",

Additionally,\nprovide the ServiceHub resources\nso your team is prepared to use ServiceHub:\nGetting Started and Training Resources on ServiceHub\neSupport vs ServiceHub Comparison Chart\nRESOLVE AND CLOSE YOUR ESUPPORT TICKETS\nTo minimize the impact\nduring and after\nthe transition to ServiceHub, we strongly encourage you to\nresolve any open eSupport tickets\nthat you're able to. For details on eSupport behaviours after transitioning, see\nContinue monitoring your eSupport queues for any activity\non this article.\nMAKING THE TRANSITION:\nFor Enterprise IT and ITS queues\nFor most users, no action needed. IT Services will automatically complete the transition for ITS queues on July 11. ITS groups who have unique eSupport setups will be contacted to assist with the transition.\nFor members of the local IT community\nOnce you are ready to transition to eSupport, you will have to\nupdate the delivery email address\nfrom \"esupport@rcg.sfu.ca\" to \"sfutdx@sfu.ca\" for\neach of your email support points\n. Once you make this change,\nnew incoming emails\nfrom your support points will automatically generate a ticket on ServiceHub in the corresponding Responsible Group.\nFor instructions, visit\nChange the delivery email address\n. If you need assistance with this process, you may request additional support at\nESM Request a Service\n.\nAFTER TRANSITION:\nTEST YOUR EMAIL SUPPORT POINTS\nAfter the transition,\ntest your email support points\nto ensure that incoming tickets are routed correctly to generate a ticket on Service Hub and not in eSupport. Check the details of the test email message to make sure it ended up in the correct Responsible Group on Service Hub and that the reply-to is the ServiceHub email.\nCONTINUE MONITORING YOUR ESUPPORT QUEUES FOR ANY ACTIVITY\nSince not every eSupport queue will immediately transition to ServiceHub on launch date (such as some non-ITS groups), we recommend you to continue monitoring your eSupport queues to see if any correspondences or tickets go to your eSupport queue.\nFor in-progress and open tickets, client replies will still appear on eSupport. To avoid working within two ticketing apps, we recommend that you resolve the ticket or advise your clients on open tickets to create a new ticket on ServiceHub then close your eSupport tickets.\nFAQ\nWhat happens if I don't resolve and close my eSupport tickets before transitioning?\nNothing will happen to those tickets after transitioning, however, resolving and closing tickets ensure that you don't continue visiting both eSupport and ServiceHub.\nClients can still respond by email to existing or unresolved eSupport tickets and those messages will still route and appear in eSupport. On existing or unresolved tickets, we recommend you to resolve those tickets or advise the requestor to create a new ticket on ServiceHub if they wish to receive further assistance then close your eSupport tickets.\nI don't know my email support points. How do I find out my email support points?\nAll eSupport email points need to be changed and re-routed to Service Hub. Please take a look at our\neSupport Email Routing List\nand\nlook up your queue\nto see a list of email accounts that needs to be updated.\nI can't log into the ServiceHub Ticketing Portal (TDNext). How do I get access?\nThere are two common reasons you may have not have access to the ticketing app:\nYou're not on one of the TDX Responsible Group Maillist to be given technician role. Ask your service owner/manager to add you to the \"tdx-group-<responsible group>\" maillist.\nYou're using a sponsored account. All staff/faculty accounts have an account by default with ServiceHub. If you would like to use a sponsored account, submit a request with\nESM Request a Service\n.\nCan I migrate all my eSupport tickets to ServiceHub?\nAt this time, moving tickets from eSupport to Service Hub has to be done manually and one-by-one. Please take a look at\nMoving Tickets from eSupport to ServiceHub\n.\nWhich are the Phase 2 Groups that will transition to ServiceHub at a later date?\nTo assist ticket management and workflows with Phase 1 groups during the transition, here is a list of Phase 2 groups that will transition to ServiceHub at a later date:\nAdvancement & Alumni Engagement\nCFD Pivot 2020\nCMPT Tech Support\nCommunications and Marketing\nCRM Support\nData Warehouse\nFAS Tech\nFITS eTRACS\nIRMACS\nIRP\nLifelong Learning\nRoom Finder Support\nStudent Services\nSUPPORT RESOURCES\nIf you have questions, connect with us at\nMS Teams - One I.S - TeamDynamix Channel\nor submitting a request at\nEnterprise Service Management\n.",

    "clean_body_text": "Administrative and Business\nBusiness Capability and Process Automation\nEnterprise Service Management\neSupport Migration\nOVERVIEW\nUnlike eSupport, there are two main channels for communicating ticket updates with requestors in TeamDynamix. The first is via traditional\nemail (notifying)\n, while the second is via the\nticket feed (commenting)\n. In this article, we'll provide an overview of the two and what you can expect for commenting versus notifying in TeamDynamix.\nDETAILS\nThere are two important sections to know about when updating a ticket in TeamDynamix. Both are\nindependent from each other\nbut can control how a requestor receives updates.\nThe first is the \"comments\" section, which adds a comment to the\nticket feed\n. Unlike eSupport, comments can be both private or public depending on what the \"\nMake comments private...\n\" option is set to:\nComments that are private, will only be visible to other ticketing agents.\nIn addition to commenting, the \"Notify\" section also plays a role in how updates are sent. Notify determines if an email notification is sent to whoever is listed in the notify fields. Unlike eSupport, you must ensure the requestors are included in the \"Notify\" field to notify the them of an update.\nNote\n: Both the commenting and notify fields\ncan be used in combination with each other\n. It is possible to mark a comment as private but still notify a requestor if they are included in the notify field. This will cause anyone notified to see the private comment.\nSee our\nFAQ\nfor details on this behaviour.\nWHAT IS THE TICKET \"FEED\" AND HOW DOES IT RELATE TO COMMENTS?\nThe ticket feed is a list of updates or changes associated with a ticket.

    "clean_body_text": "Administrative and Business\nBusiness Capability and Process Automation\nEnterprise Service Management\nFor Ticketing Agents\nOVERVIEW\nThis article contains frequently asked questions about ServiceHub Ticketing App (TDNext) for ticketing agents and technicians.\nGeneral\nWhat is ServiceHub, TeamDynamix, Enterprise Service Management, etc.?\nEnterprise Service Management (ESM) is the overarching service run by IT Services that utilizes the different suite of tools provided by TeamDynamix. This includes IT Service Management (ITSM) and Project Portfolio Management (PPM) in the future.\nSee the architecture below:\nCan I use a sponsored account with ServiceHub Ticketing App?\nYes, however, not all sponsored accounts will have an account on ServiceHub (TeamDynamix account) by default. If you cannot log in with your sponsored account, see\nHow to gain access to ServiceHub Ticketing App\n.\nI can't log into the ServiceHub Ticketing Portal (TDNext). How do I get access?\nThere are two common reasons you may have not have access to the ticketing app:\nYou're not on one of the TDX Responsible Group Maillist to be given technician role. Ask your service owner/manager to\nadd you to a Responsible Group\n.\nYou're using a sponsored account or is outside of ITS and haven't been registered on the TDNext application.\nTo gain access, see\nHow to gain access to ServiceHub Ticketing App\n.\nNotifications and Messaging\nWho gets an email notification when I comment on a ticket?\nBy default, no one will receive an email notification when you comment on a ticket regardless of the \"Only visible to ITS Tickets User\" checkbox. Only users selected on the \"Notify\" field when commenting or updating a ticket will receive an email notification.\nWho gets an email notification when the requestor replies to the ticket or my comment?\nEveryone on the \"People\" tab of the ticket will receive an email notification of the Requestor's email reply or comments. By default, it will only be the user/group set as the Primary Responsibility. Adding additional Contacts on the \"People\" tab will allow the user to receive email notification when the Requestor replies or comments.\nWhat is the difference between \"Comment\" and \"Update\" on a ticket?\nThe \"Comment\" feature is typically used to\nsend a message quickly\n. The \"Update\" feature provides a\nmore versatile\nfunction of \"Comment\" by popping out and showing more fields and features. In addition to sending a message, \"Update\" can\nchange a ticket status\nor\nsend an attachment\n.\nWhat does the \"only visible to ITS Tickets user\" check box do?\nSending a private message (through comment or update) with the box\nchecked\nwill do the following:\nPost a message on the ticket feed that only viewable on the ITS Ticketing App / TDNext (only to those who have access to the ITS Ticketing App).\nIf you have selected to notify individuals, all the individuals selected to be notified will receive an email notification with the message (regardless if they are ticket agents or an external email).\nSending a public message (through comment or update) with this box\nunchecked\nwill do the following:\nIf you have no one selected to be notified, no one will receive an email notification, including the Requestor.\nCan I send a ticket message to an external email?\nYes, you can send a message to an external, non-SFU email on the \"Other Email Addresses\" field under \"Update\" on a ticket.\nHow do I add a Comment Template for ticket responses?\n\"Comment Templates\" are available to all ticketing agents on the ServiceHub Ticketing App. If you wish to add a \"Comment Template\", please submit a request at\nESM Request a Service\n.\nHow do I Add a Comment signature on the ServiceHub Ticketing App?\nAt this time, ServiceHub does not support a way to handle signatures. You'll have to copy/paste it from another source each time you send a message or use a browser plug in.\nHow do I resolve a ticket without notifying the requestor?\nTo change the status of a ticket without notifying, you can \"Edit\" or \"Update\" the ticket status. Ensure that you have the \"Notify\" field empty.\nAre requestors able to reply to a resolved or closed ticket?\nYes. If a ticket status is set to \"Resolved\", Requestors replying to the ticket within 3 business days will set the ticket status to \"In Progress\". If a ticket status is set to \"Resolved\" and 3 business days have elapsed, the ticket status will automatically be set to \"Closed\" and further replies from the Requestor will generate a new ticket.\nTicket Management\nWhat is the difference between resolved and closed for ticket status?\nWhen a ticket is \"Resolved\", any replies from the Requestor will set the ticket status back to \"In Progress\". When a ticket is \"Closed\", any replies from the Requestor will generate a new ticket.\nA client used an incorrect form and I have a ticket that I don't support. What should I do?\nWe recommend that you reassign the ticket to the Responsibility Group, \"ITS Service Desk (BBY)\". They are the most knowledgeable on triaging tickets and will be able to direct it to the correct Responsible Group.\nDo I have to enter in the \"Estimated Hours\" for my tickets?\nThat would depend on your Responsible Group. Some Service Owners and Managers may use feature to assist with service management, such as for resourcing and reporting purposes.\nCan other Ticketing Agents outside my responsible group take or edit my tickets?\nYes, all ticketing agent in the ServiceHub Tickets app have full control to any tickets. Responsible Groups are not private or read-only to other ticketing agents outside the Responsible Group.\nWhat do I with tickets containing sensitive information or security incidents?\nYou can transfer the ticket to a Confidential Ticketing App by selecting \"Actions\" > \"Assign Workflow\". Please note that once you transfer the ticket to a Confidential Ticketing App, you will no longer have access to the ticket.\nWhat should I do with Spam tickets?\nIf you encounter any spam tickets, you can set the ticket status to \"Rejected\".\nOther\nHow do I find the Requestor's Computing ID on TeamDynamix?\nTo find a user's computing ID, open the user's profile by click on their name (such as on a ticket or desktop view). You can see the user's computing ID under \"Organizational ID\".\nDoes the Ticket views or Desktop auto-refresh?\nUnfortunately, no. At this time, TeamDynamix does not have ticket views or desktops auto-refresh. The only widget that updates in real time is \"My Feed\" under My Work. We suggest looking into browser plug-ins to auto-refresh the page until TeamDynamix implements the feature.\nHow is privacy and confidentiality handled by teamdynamix?\nTeamDynamix have been reviewed by our Privacy Office and the application have met their requirements. TeamDynamix stores all its data on a Canadian data centre. TeamDynamix also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.\nFor security and confidentiality for handling tickets, tickets with sensitive information will be in (or moved into) Confidential Ticketing Apps on ServiceHub to minimize exposure. These Confidential Ticketing Apps can only be accessible to select SFU technicians and administrators.",

Shared accounts can be shared among multiple users and groups. The SFU Print team can work with you to determine how your shared accounts can be set up to work with your department. Examples of how shared accounts can be used:\nTracking printing/copying costs by course (BISC 101, BISC 102, etc)\nTracking printing/copying costs by research grants\nThis article has additional information on:\nTwo types of shared accounts\nSetting up shared accounts in pin codes\nSetting up shared accounts in account lists\nPrinting and Photocopying with shared accounts overview\nAccount Management\nTWO TYPES OF SHARED ACCOUNTS\nThere are two options for using Shared Accounts:\nPIN Codes:\nUsers can charge to shared accounts by entering a PIN code when they print or copy. This works similarly to the functionality on the old Konica-Minoltas.\nAccount List:\nWhen printing or copying, users can select from a list of shared accounts that they have been granted access to. Access to shared accounts will be granted through maillists. There is no limit to the number of accounts that an individual can have access to.\nThe table below gives an overview of the pros and cons of each option:\nPros\nCons\nPIN Codes\nEasier to give access to a shared account - only need to share the PIN\nPIN codes can easily updated in a batch and can easily remove access on a semesterly basis..\nMore difficult to control who is charging to the account.\nUsers have to remember their PIN code for every shared account.\nAccount List\nUsers do not need to remember a PIN. They can simply select the account they see on their screen\nMore control over who has access to charge to the account.\nMore administration required - need to regularly update the permissions if users are regularly changing.\nSETTING UP SHARED ACCOUNTS\nSETTING UP PIN CODES\nPlease note that users will need the PaperCut client installed for this option to work.\nFind out how to set up the PaperCut client here.\nIf your PC/Mac is a managed device, please contact your IT Administrator to help you install it.\nStep 1:\nCreate an Excel spreadsheet with the following headings in columns A-D. Fill out the information under each column. For further clarification, refer to the\nPIN Code Template Sample\nor visit the website here:\nhttp://i.sfu.ca/HkolfB\nColumn A: Department Name (Ex. BEEDIE)\nColumn B: Sub Account Name (Ex. Course #)\nColumn C: Enabled (Y/N)\nColumn D: PIN (Ex. 12345)\nStep 2:\nEmail the spreadsheet to\npapercut-senior-admins@sfu.ca\nand\nIT Services will batch import accounts into PaperCut. PIN Codes will be synced to PaperCut. This will take approximately one day to sync.\nStep 3:\nCreate a maillist at\nmaillist.sfu.ca\nwith the following conventions:\nabbreviated campus name-mps-abbreviated department name-pins\nFor example: \"bby-mps-geog-pins\"\nStep 4:\nAdd all users who will need to use PINs into this maillist. We will use this maillist to update the specified user profiles so that they are given the option to enter a PIN when printing/copying. When activated, users will be prompted to enter a PIN upon printing or copying.\nSETTING UP ACCOUNT LISTS\nStep 1:\nCreate a spreadsheet with three columns\nColumn A: Department Name (Should be the same for all)\nColumn B: Account Name (This is what the user selects on the screen)\nColumn C: Name of Maillist controlling access to the shared account\nStep 2:\nCreate the maillists entered above at\nmaillist.sfu.ca\nwith the naming conventions below. Add users who will need access to the shared accounts into the corresponding maillist.\nabbreviated campus name-mps-abbreviated department name-account\ni.e. \"bby-mps-geog-research101\"\nStep 3:\nCreate a maillist with the naming conventions below and nest all the maillists above into this maillist. This maillist will be used to control which users get prompted to select an account list. Otherwise, users will continue to automatically charge to their department.\nabbreviated campus name-mps-abbreviated department name-pins\ni.e. \"bby-mps-geog-pins\"\nStep 4:\nEmail\npapercut-senior-admins@sfu.ca\nwith the spreadsheet of shared accounts and maillists.\nStep 5:\nThe maillist will then be synced to Active Directory and PaperCut. This will take approximately one day.\nStep 6:\nYour Shared Account List will populate in PaperCut. You will then be able to see and select your newly created Shared Account.\nPRINTING AND PHOTOCOPYING WITH SHARED ACCOUNTS OVERVIEW\nUSING ACCOUNT LISTS\nA) Printing -\nthe list is accessed on the computer with the PaperCut client installed.\nB) Photocopying -\nthe list is accessed on the Ricoh multi-function device.\nUSING PIN CODES\nA) Printing -\nthe PIN is entered on the computer with the PaperCut client installed.\nB) Photocopying -\nthe PIN Code is entered on the Ricoh multi-function device.\nACCOUNT MANAGEMENT\nWhen setting up your billing options, email\npapercut-senior-admins@sfu.ca\nwith the person in charge of your department for administering printing and indicate their SFU username.\nThis must be completed in order to get access to the link below.\nTo manage PIN Codes and Shared Accounts, click here:\nhttps://papercut-staff.mps.sfu.ca:9192/admin\nThis will give you access to administrative privileges such as:\nPaperCut Reporting\nUser Management",

    "clean_body_text": "SFU Print for Administrators\nOVERVIEW\nBelow is a list of frequently asked questions about the SFU Print billing.\nFrequently Asked Questions about SFU Print Billing\nHOW WILL BILLING BE CHANGED?\nThe billing itself will remain unchanged and continue to be billed-by-device. Your department will continue to be charged for the usage on your device.\nCAN I SEE WHO IS PRINTING TO MY DEVICE?\nYes! You can request monthly reports from PaperCut which will show a breakdown of user usage for each device. Please contact\nIT Service Desk\nto get regular reporting set up.\nWHAT HAPPENED TO BILLING-BY-USER?\nAfter evaluating our existing infrastructure and meeting departments to understand their business processes, we've identified that implementing a billing-by-user model right now would increase the manual work required by departments and would not add value for the University. There are concurrect projects that are in progress that will improve the University's infrastructure and business processes which will make a new billing model more viable in the future.\nCHARGES IN MY DEPARTMENT USED TO BE TRACKED SEPARATELY BY THEIR FUNCTION (COURSES, RESEARCH GRANTS, ETC). HOW DO I DO THIS IN SFU PRINT?\nShared accounts can be created in PaperCut to track printing and copying charges separately. Shared accounts can be shared among multiple users and groups.

Sign into\nMy Mediasite\nand activate your account\nWhen you first sign into\nMy Mediasite\n(stream.sfu.ca), you will be prompted to validate your account by email and confirm additional details:\nSign into\nstream.sfu.ca\nusing your SFU computing ID and password.\nEnter your display name, confirm your SFU email (should be autofilled), then select\nContinue\n.\nCheck your SFU inbox for an email with the subject line \"Mediasite account activation request\". Click the provided link to complete the Mediasite account activation process.\n2. Use the \"Add Media\" button to upload or record a presentation from your computer\nOnce you've signed into My Mediasite, you can upload or record a presentation:\nSelect\nAdd Presentation\nYou can upload a video from your computer or\nrecord a new one using the Mediasite Desktop Recorder App\n.\nOnce a file or recording is finished uploading, the video will need to process before it is ready for your audience. Depending on the size of your video and the number of users uploading to the system, this can take up to 24 hours.\n1. Recommended VIDEO settings for Faster upload\nRecommended settings for Video Files\nContainer Format:\nMP4\nResolution:\nA maximum resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels\nVideo Codec:\nH.264\nAudio Codec:\nAAC\nFrame Rate:\n24 frames per second\n(if you are only recording your slides, set this to 15 fps)\nDuration:\nWe recommend keeping individual videos to less than 3 hours\nFile Size:\nA one-hour video should not be larger than 2 GB.\n(Please compress the video if it is unusually large)\nADVANCED USERS\nFor faster processing, make sure your video contains the following properties:\nA Keyframe Interval of less than 6 seconds\nAn Aspect Ratio that uses Square (1:1) pixels\nA bitrate of 1.5 Mbps or less\nAudio tracks with a 44.1 Khz sample rate\nRequired settings\nfor Sound Files\nContainer Format:\nMP3\nBitrate:\n128 kbps or less\nSample rate:\n44.1 khz\n(48 Khz will also work)\n2. Why is my video taking a long time to become available?\nOnce your file is finished uploading to SFU's servers, it usually needs to be re-processed into a format that is optimised for on-demand streaming.\nProcessing times average well under an hour, but some things can affect this processing time.\nSFU is continually looking to improve the performance of the Mediasite platform. Below are some things to watch out for when uploading videos.\nAn incorrect file was uploaded (e.g. uploading a PowerPoint\n.\npptx\nfile instead of a video file)\nUploading very large, uncompressed video files. If you are using a video editor, try exporting with a lower bitrate (we recommend 1.5 Mbps)\nSometimes, the wait is happening\nbefore\nthe processing stage. If the status of the video lists \"Queued for Processing\", then your video has not yet begun processing. This wait time can go above the usual 10-20 minutes when too many people are uploading at the same time. If your video spends too much time waiting in the queue, try uploading your content at a different time of day.\nWhen making videos using Zoom or PowerPoint it is important to acquire a video file. If a non-video file is uploaded to Mediasite you will not receive an error. Mediasite will keep trying to convert the file but will fail after a long time.\nZoom Recordings\nWhen using the Zoom local recording feature, Zoom will create a special temporary file. This file will end with \"\n.zoom\n\". After a recording finishes, please allow Zoom some time to process this file and produce a file that ends with \".\nmp4\n\"\nPowerPoint Recordings\nMicrosoft PowerPoint will allow you to make a recording of your presentation. PowerPoint files end with \"\n.\npptx\n\". When your presentation recording is complete you must export the video to produce a usable video file. This file should end with \".\nmp4\n\".\nFor best results, see \"1. Recommend video settings for faster upload\" above.\n3. How many videos can i upload?\nIn response to the rapid transition to remote teaching, SFU has removed any storage quotas for videos uploaded to Mediasite until further notice.\n4. What kind of files can I upload?\nMediasite accepts a wide variety of video and audio formats. Popular formats that are supported are listed below. If you are hoping to upload a different file format, please send an email to its-help@sfu.ca\nVideo:\nmp4, avi, mov, flv, m4v, mkv, wmv\nAudio:\nmp3, wav, vob,\nPlease note that very large files and videos with a very long duration may have difficulty being processed by the server.\nProcessing times for Media Uploads can vary based on capacity and can take several hours to complete processing. 4K Video is not currently supported.\n5. How long can i keep my videos?\nAny content you upload yourself will remain available for as long as your SFU account remains active.\nClass recordings can be downloaded to your own computer or transferred to your My Mediasite account for long-term storage.\n3. Decide who can access your video\nOnce your video has completed processing, you can make it viewable to your audience by sliding the \"WHO CAN VIEW?\"\ntoggle switch to the appropriate setting.\nFor most recordings, we recommend setting it to the\nMy Organization\npermission level:\nEveryone\nThis will make the video open to the public. Anyone with the link can watch the video without logging in.\nMy Organization\nAny SFU user with an active Computing Account\nOnly Shared Users\nUsers you have added manually using the \"Share\" button\nOnly Me\nThis will make the video private. Only the owner of the video can watch the content.\nIf you have sensitive material and only want to share it to a list of allowed users, please\nsubmit a ticket\nso IT Services can advise accordingly.\n1. Why does my video become private after the upload is finished processing?\nThis is the default behaviour and it is a safety feature. If you upload a video, this behaviour will encourage you to take a moment and verify that it is indeed the correct video before it becomes watchable by your audience.\nIf you would like the videos you upload to automatically publish without a chance to verify the contents, please follow these instructions:\nClick on the face icon to the right of \"Moderation\" and navigate to the \"\nMy Settings\n\" page\nNavigate to the \"\nPublishing\n\" options\nSet the option \"Set visibility of MyMediasite uploads as viewable\" so that it is \"TRUE\".\nSave\nTo quickly get to this configuration page, please visit this link:\nhttps://stream.sfu.ca/media/mymediasite/settings/publish-settings\n4. Share your video\nEmbed videos in Canvas\nThere are a few ways to share your videos. IT Services recommends\nusing Canvas to share your content\n. You can use the \"embed video\" option for individual videos.\nFor other ways to share, select\nShare Presentation\n.\nQuick Link or QR Code\nCopy the quick link or QR code and share it as you'd like ex. through email or Canvas.\nDirect Invite by Email\nSelect the\nInvite by Email\ntab\nEnter the email addresses you'd like to share a video link. Use a semicolon ; to separate each address.\nWrite a personal message, if desired.\nSelect\nSend Invite\n.\nMediasite will warn you if permissions are not set to \"everyone\". Depending on your audience, you may need to adjust your video permissions (see Step 3: Decide who can access your video) before sending the invitation.\nEmbed Code\nIf you're familiar with HTML code, you can use the embed code to embed the video within SFU web pages or Canvas Course pages.\n1. How do I share multiple videos at once?\nThe My Mediasite application allows you to share multiple videos with your audience using \"Channels\". These playlists can be shared with students or other users, or they can be embedded inside of a Canvas course.\nTo create a channel, please look at our\nhow-to guide on sharing videos using a playlist/channel\n.\n5.

    "clean_body_text": "Teaching and Learning\nLecture Capture\nVideo Hosting\nOverview\nThis article explains how to use the Mediasite Desktop Recorder to record your lectures.\nMediasite Desktop Recorder allows you to capture and record your computer's desktop, webcam and microphone. Recordings that are in-progress can be paused so that you can deliver your presentation at your own pace. When recordings are finished, they can be published to your MyMediasite account where it can be shared with your audience. Mediasite also features a web-based editor so that you may trim the start and end of your recording or make simple edits.\nNote:\nIT Services has been improving the login security for the Mediasite platform. Please note that this will have an effect on the use of Mediasite Desktop Recorder.\nMediasite Desktop Recorder sessions must be started from stream.sfu.ca, as per the instructions below.\nRecording durations cannot exceed 2 hours.\nDOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING MEDIASITE DESKTOP RECORDER (MDR)\nIf this is your first time using MDR, you will need to install the desktop software to perform your recordings:\nLog into the\nMyMediasite portal\nClick\nAdd Presentation\nClick the\nMore Information button\nunder \"Capturing video requires an app.\"\nClick on the download button that corresponds with your operating system. Installers are only available for Windows and Mac operating systems.\nNote: For\nmacOS Catalina users, the MDR download in My Mediasite may not work correctly on your system. Instead, please install \"Mediasite Capture\" from the Mac App Store or by visiting\nMediasite Capture - App Store\nin browser.\nRECORDING A PRESENTATION ON YOUR COMPUTER\nOnce the MDR software is registered with your My Mediasite account, you will be able to start using MyMediasite to begin new recording sessions. It is also possible to begin a new Presentation from MDR, but we recommend starting in MyMediasite.\nStep 1: Click Add Media to begin setting up your recording session.\nSelect the option \"\nI want to record my desktop now\n\" to begin using MDR for a recording session. This will prompt you for more details before attempting to launch the MDR software on your computer.\nStep 2: Enter your Presentation details and click \"Create and Launch\"\nMediasite will require you to give the Presentation a title before you can begin. The description is optional but recommended.\nOnce you click \"Create and Launch\", the web browser will download a Mediasite launcher and ask you to open the file in the MDR software. If this is your first time using MDR, please refer to the instructions for \"\nUsing MDR for the first time\n\" further up on this page.\nStep 3: Configure your recording preferences\nDR will allow you to capture any combination of your webcam, microphone and anything appearing on your desktop. Pick a combination from the available options.\nOnce you have chosen the type of recording you would like to make, you can either select \"Record\" or you can click on \"Next\" to double-check or change options for your microphone and camera. We recommend using the \"Next\" option and always verifying that the correct devices have been selected.\nStep 4: Begin recording your Presentation\nWhile you are recording, MDR provides a Preview window. This will show your camera if you are using one, however if it is on-screen for the recording, a message will replace the image to let you know that it might be recorded accidentally.\nIf you need to take a break or would like to perform in short bursts, MDR allows you to pause and resume your recording. This can be done from the MDR Preview window, or by clicking an icon in the System Tray for your computer.\nIf you discard your recording, MDR will erase whatever has been recorded and bring you back to\nStep 3\nso that you may try again.\nStep 5: Finish your recording\nAfter you have completed your recording, the video will be automatically uploaded to your My Mediasite account. If you would like to choose when your video is uploaded to the system, you can change the default behaviour in the Settings\narea for the MDR software.\nLater, if you decide you would like to re-record your Presentation you can begin a new recording session from the same Presentation in My Mediasite.\nStep 6:\nWhen you're ready, make the video viewable for your audiencNo\nNote: By default, when a video is uploaded to My Mediasite, the \"WHO CAN VIEW?\" toggle for the video in My Mediasite will always be reset to \"\nOnly Me\n\".\nBefore your audience can watch the video, you must change the \"WHO CAN VIEW?\" toggle to another setting. This can only be changed after your video has finished processing.\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nClassroom Technology - Request Lecture Recording\nRecord course presentations hosted in SFU campus lecture theaters or class rooms.",

General Information\n1. What is mediasite?\nMediasite is the platform used by SFU to automate scheduled recordings in supported rooms. Recordings are captured based on your SFU Course Outline information and can be distributed through Canvas. A browser-based video editor is also available to make your own adjustments to your recordings.\n2. How is my mediasite different from mediasite?\nMy Mediasite is a Content Management System for streaming video available to SFU Faculty & Staff.\nIt allows users to make changes to lecture recordings, upload new videos, control their visibility and create playlists of other videos from your library that you can share with other SFU users.\nMy Mediasite can be accessed at http://stream.sfu.ca or through Canvas by enabling the My Mediasite app for your course.\n2. Uploading and Managing Content\n3. What kind of files can I upload?\nMediasite accepts a wide variety of video and audio formats. Popular formats that are supported are listed below. If you are hoping to upload a different file format, please send an email to its-help@sfu.ca\nVideo:\nmp4, avi, mov, flv, m4v, mkv, wmv\nAudio:\nmp3, wav, vob,\nPlease note that very large files and videos with a very long duration may have difficulty being processed by the server.\nProcessing times for Media Uploads can vary based on capacity and can take several hours to complete processing. 4K Video is not currently supported.\nRecommended settings for Video Files\nContainer Format:\nMP4\nResolution:\nA maximum resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels\nVideo Codec:\nH.264\nAudio Codec:\nAAC\nFrame Rate:\n24 frames per second\n(if you are only recording your slides, set this to 15 fps)\nDuration:\nWe recommend keeping individual videos to less than 3 hours\nFile Size:\nA one-hour video should not be larger than 2 GB.\n(Please compress the video if it is unusually large)\nADVANCED USERS\nFor faster processing, make sure your video contains the following properties:\nA Keyframe Interval of less than 6 seconds\nAn Aspect Ratio that uses Square (1:1) pixels\nA bitrate of 1.5 Mbps or less\nAudio tracks with a 44.1 Khz sample rate\nRequired settings\nfor Sound Files\nContainer Format:\nMP3\nBitrate:\n128 kbps or less\nSample rate:\n44.1 khz\n(48 Khz will also work)\n4. How much can I upload?\nIn response to the rapid transition to remote teaching, SFU has removed any storage quotas for videos uploaded to Mediasite until further notice.\n5. How long can I keep videos?\nITS will delete class recordings that are more than one year old, but any content you upload yourself will remain available for as long as your SFU account remains active.\nClass recordings and uploads can be downloaded to your own computer or transferred to your My Mediasite account for long-term storage.\n3. Viewing and Sharing Content\n6. Who can see my videos?\nVisibility for your uploaded videos can be managed through My Mediasite.\nUse the \"Who can view?\" toggle to set the type of security. Limiting access to particular users or groups can be done using the \"Share Presentation\" or \"Edit Security\" buttons and adding your user or group as a \"Viewer\".\nBy setting the toggle to \"Only Me\", visibility can be disabled temporarily in case you need to make adjustments to a video before distributing to your students. Videos will still appear wherever they are listed, but will not be allow playback until visibility is re-enabled.\n7. Why is my video taking a long time to become available?\nOnce your file is finished uploading to SFU's servers, it usually needs to be re-processed into a format that is optimised for on-demand streaming.\nProcessing times average well under an hour, but some things can affect this processing time.\nSFU is continually looking to improve the performance of the Mediasite platform. Below are some things to watch out for when uploading videos.\nAn incorrect file was uploaded (e.g. uploading a PowerPoint\n.\npptx\nfile instead of a video file)\nUploading very large, uncompressed video files. If you are using a video editor, try exporting with a lower bitrate (we recommend 1.5 Mbps)\nSometimes, the wait is happening\nbefore\nthe processing stage. If the status of the video lists \"Queued for Processing\", then your video has not yet begun processing. This wait time can go above the usual 10-20 minutes when too many people are uploading at the same time. If your video spends too much time waiting in the queue, try uploading your content at a different time of day.\nEnsuring the following properties for your video can help decrease processing times.\nRecommended settings for Video Files\nContainer Format:\nMP4\nResolution:\n1920 x 1080 pixels\n(1280 x 720 is also recommended)\nVideo Codec:\nH.264\nAudio Codec:\nAAC\nFrame Rate:\n24 frames per second\n(if you are only recording your slides, set this to 15 fps)\nDuration:\nWe recommend keeping individual videos to less than 3 hours\nFile Size:\nA one-hour video should not be larger than 2 GB.\n(Please compress the video if it is unusually large)\nADVANCED USERS\nFor faster processing, make sure your video contains the following properties:\nA Keyframe Interval of less than 6 seconds\nAn Aspect Ratio that uses Square (1:1) pixels\nA bitrate of 1.5 Mbps or less\nAudio tracks with a 44.1 Khz sample rate\nRequired settings\nfor Sound Files\nContainer Format:\nMP3\nBitrate:\n128 kbps or less\nSample rate:\n44.1 khz\n(48 Khz will also work)\n4. Assignments and Submissions\n8. Can my students submit assignments this way?\nAt this time, only faculty and staff may request recordings or upload content. Allowing students to submit assignments through Mediasite is currently outside of the scope of the Lecture Capture service.\nStudents and faculty can share files with one another using\nSFU Canvas\n.\n5. Technical Issues and Troubleshooting\n9. WHY DOES MY VIDEO BECOME \"PRIVATE\" AFTER THE UPLOAD IS FINISHED PROCESSING?\nThis is the default behaviour and it is a safety feature. If you upload a video, this behaviour will encourage you to take a moment and verify that it is indeed the correct video before it becomes watchable by your audience.\nIf you would like the videos you upload to automatically publish without a chance to verify the contents, please follow these instructions:\nClick on the face icon to the right of \"Moderation\" and navigate to the \"\nMy Settings\n\" page\nNavigate to the \"\nPublishing\n\" options\nSet the option \"Set visibility of MyMediasite uploads as viewable\" so that it is \"TRUE\".\nSave\nTo quickly get to this configuration page, please visit this link:\nhttps://stream.sfu.ca/media/mymediasite/settings/publish-settings\n13. WHY DOES THE UPLOAD OF MY RECORDING FROM ZOOM OR POWERPOINT FAIL OR TAKE TOO LONG?\nIf you encounter a failure after waiting for a long time, make sure you are uploading a video file.\nWhen making videos using Zoom or PowerPoint it is important to acquire a video file. If a non-video file is uploaded to Mediasite you will not receive an error. Mediasite will keep trying to convert the file but will fail after a long time.\nZoom Recordings\nWhen using the Zoom local recording feature, Zoom will create a special temporary file. This file will end with \"\n.zoom\n\". After a recording finishes, please allow Zoom some time to process this file and produce a file that ends with \".\nmp4\n\"\nPowerPoint Recordings\nMicrosoft PowerPoint will allow you to make a recording of your presentation. PowerPoint files end with \"\n.\npptx\n\". When your presentation recording is complete you must export the video to produce a usable video file. This file should end with \".\nmp4\n\".\n6. Embedding and Linking Content\n10. How can I share videos using a playlist?\nThe My Mediasite application allows you to share multiple videos with your audience using \"Channels\". These playlists can be shared with students or other users, or\nthey can be embedded inside of a Canvas course.\nChannels also enable the following optional features:\nDownload links for your audience (see Question #8 for more details)\nComments from your audience\nChannel customizations\nTo create a channel, please look at our\nhow-to guide on sharing videos using a playlist/channel\n11. Some of my embedded videos do not show up in canvas. What is going on?\nAn issue was discovered that affects some Mediasite videos within Canvas. If a video was added by copying and pasting an embed code from MyMediasite, some users may encounter an error and the video player will not load. Any videos that were added by using\nthe Mediasite LTI for Canvas\nare not affected.\nPlease follow one of these workarounds:\nIf possible, use the Mediasite widget located in the Rich Content Editor rather than manually embedding videos.\nMore information can be found in this guide\n. If this is not suitable for you, please try one of the remaining workarounds.\nFor videos that do not require security:\nSlide the \"WHO CAN VIEW?\" toggle for your video in MyMediasite so that it is set to \"Everyone\". The error only affects videos that require authentication before viewing.\nFor videos that must be secured:\nPlease ask anyone that is experiencing this problem to navigate to the video linked below. Once they login to watch the video, they should be able to go back to the Canvas course and view the missing content. The user may need to refresh the page if it was already opened beforehand. Note that this is not a permanent fix and may have to be done again if the user is no longer logged in.\nWatch this video and then return to the page containing the error above:\nhttps://stream.sfu.ca/Media/Play/fdcd03f7b6e54072b61ce47c0aec2b7f1d\n7. Collaboration and Editing\n12. How can I let my coworker edit one of my presentations or channels?\nIf you need to provide editing privileges to a collaborator, you can make use of the green \"Edit Security\" button on your Presentation or Channel. Add the user to the list in this area, then make sure the security setting for \"Write\" has a check under \"Allow\" when clicking on their name in the list.\nMore information is available from the people who created Mediasite: https://docs.mediasite.com/76/mymediasite/#!Documents/assigncustompermissionsdesktoponly1.htm\n13. How can I add closed-captions to my videos?\nMediasite allows you to upload closed-captioning files for your videos. Simply follow the steps below to add your captioning file.\nNote: Mediasite cannot automatically create captions for you. You must upload a caption file or create your own captions using Mediasite's caption editor.\nAdd a caption file to your video:\nNavigate to your presentation. Click Edit and go to the Delivery tab.\nIf you have not already enabled captioning, select the Captioning check box.\nSelect the Manually Upload an Audio Caption File radio button and click Select a file to locate and select your closed caption file.\nClick Upload. Once the file is uploaded, launch the presentation in Mediasite Player and verify your captions appear as expected.\n8. Privacy and Permissions\n14. Can I record on campus?\nSelect theatres are available for automated Lecture Capture during the semester. Recordings in rooms can only be scheduled by using the\nLecture Capture Request Form.\nTo ensure timely scheduling, please make sure to request this service at least 10 days before the start of the semester. You can always fill out the form to begin receiving recordings, even if the semester has already started, but we will not have recordings for any classes that have already passed.\nRecordings will appear in a channel created for your class. You can send a link to this channel to your course students, which can also be added to Canvas.\n15. Can users download my videos?\nMediasite streams your video in a way that cannot easily be saved through normal use.\nIf you would like your audience to be able to easily download a copy of your video or audio presentation, please view the\nHow-to guide on allowing users to download videos",

The same rule applies to failed SSH key authentication.\nYou will not be able to SSH to rcga-linux-ts1 unless you either (1) wait 24 hours, or (2) contact\nresearch-support@sfu.ca\nwith your IPv4 address.\nCheck\nhttps://www.whatismyip.com/\nif you do not know your current\nIPv4\naddress. You will need to visit this website from the computer on which you are having trouble, not from e.g., your phone.\nTHINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RCGA-LINUX-TS1.DC.SFU.CA\nRun large jobs on your workstation, not on rcga-linux-ts1\nThis host should be used mostly for SSHing to your workstation and for lightweight work like text editing.\nSince this host is shared by others and has very limited CPU power and memory, it is not a good host to run large, long-running experiments. Rogue processes will be killed.\nUse your workstation for larger jobs.\nOnly NFSv4 shares are automounted\nAt the time of our TASC 2 server room meltdown (July 16th, 2020), some of the NFS research shares that were automounted on the old Linux terminal servers were still using NFSv3, coming from old fileservers in the TASC 2 server room. We temporarily resurrected\nrcg-linux-ts3.rcg.sfu.ca\nuntil the end of August, 2020, so that some of this NFSv3 data could be accessed, and to give us time to transfer the data to NFSv4 shares in SFU Cloud. By the end of August, 2020, all research data should be on NFSv4 servers.\nSSH is more strict\nThe SSH configuration on rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca has been hardened such that only modern, secure encryption methods are accepted. You should be able to ssh into rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca from the command-line of modern versions of Linux and macOS. If you’re a Windows user, then up-to-date versions of PuTTY and MobaXterm will also work. Note that\nCentOS 6 is too old\n! If you try to ssh into rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca from the old rcg-linux-ts3.rcg.sfu.ca terminal server (due to be retired at the end of August), you’ll get a response like this:\nno matching mac found: client hmac-sha1,umac-64@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-ripemd160,hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com,hmac-sha1-96 server hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com\nNote also that\nSSH Secure Shell for Windows is way too old\n! This software hasn’t been updated in 20 years! If you try to connect to rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca using this ancient software from the dark ages, you’ll see the following:\nTry\nPuTTY\nor\nMobaXterm\n. (The latter is preferred if you want X-Windows support.)\nThe firewall is very tight\nThe firewall rules in SFU Cloud are very restrictive, both incoming and outgoing. As for incoming rules, port 22 on rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca is open to the internet, and everything else is blocked. If you need to use another port for something, you’ll need to tunnel it via ssh. As for outgoing rules, only those ports necessary for accessing required services are open, and all other ports are blocked, including http and https. If you have a requirement to connect to an external web site, you’ll need to proxy it. For more information on how to do this, please read\nUsing the Proxy for Outgoing http/https Connections in SFU Cloud\n.\nPrinting to SFU_Print\nrcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca is configured to be able to print to\nSFU_Print\nfrom the command-line, using Kerberos authentication. (The CentOS 6 servers were too old work with SFU_Print.) For detailed information on how this works, please see our\nPrinting from Linux to SFU_Print\ndocumentation.\nOLD RCG LINUX TERMINAL SERVERS\nThese Linux terminal servers were\nretired on July 17th, 2020\n, and they will not be coming back:\nrcg-linux-ts1.rcg.sfu.ca\nrcg-linux-ts2.rcg.sfu.ca\n(\nrcg-linux-ts1.rcg.sfu.ca\nalso used to be known by its DNS alias\nlinux.cs.sfu.ca\n, but that alias now points to the new\nrcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca\nserver.)\nThis Linux terminal server is due to be retired by the end of August, 2020:\nrcg-linux-ts3.rcg.sfu.ca\nThese were VMs running the very old CentOS 6 Linux.

    "clean_body_text": "Research\nResearch-Specific Computing and Applications\nThe printers that are managed by the Research Computing Group are, with few exceptions, blocked from direct printing. Printers like to advertise their presence on the network with various broadcast protocols that your computer might recognize. However, if you attempt to print to them, your printing will, in general, fail. Because printers consume real resources that cost money, we like to keep track of who prints how much. For that reason, we use print servers. Only the print servers are allowed to print directly to printers, and users must print via the print servers.\nRCG Print Server in SFU Cloud\nThis new RCG\nCUPS\nand\nsamba\nserver was set up in the fall of 2019:\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nThis is a VM running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and it exists within a VMware NSX environment known as “SFU Cloud”, physically located in the Water Tower Data Centre at SFU Burnaby.\nOld RCG Print Server\nThis old RCG\nCUPS\nand\nSamba\nserver was\nretired on July 17th, 2020\n, and it will not be coming back:\nrcg-bluebell.rcg.sfu.ca\nThis VM was running the very old CentOS 6 Linux. It existed on a KVM hypervisor located in SFU Burnaby’s TASC 2 server room which suffered a power distribution meltdown on the night of July 16th, 2020.\nWhat is CUPS?\nCUPS\nis the “Common Unix Printing System”, used by most Linux distributions and Mac OS X. This is what queues the print jobs on\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nand sends them to the printers. It also keeps track of who prints how many pages.\nIf you want to see what printers are available and what their status is, point your web browser here:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/\nNote that for security reasons, this URL will only work on-campus and not remotely.\nIf you get a certificate warning, you should download and install the RCG CA Certificate. For details, please see our SSL documentation.\nIf you want to see what print jobs are sitting in the queue, point your web browser here:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/jobs/\nIf you want to cancel your print job, you need to log-in using your campus computing account name and password.\nWhat is Samba?\nSamba\nis used to re-share the\nCUPS\nprinters to Windows computers. Windows computers print to\nsamba\nprinter shares on:\n\\\\rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\\\nand then\nsamba\nsends the print job into the corresponding\nCUPS\nqueue. To check the status of your print job, or to cancel it, use the aforementioned URLs.\nNOTE\n: On the new\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nserver, the\nCUPS\nqueues names used by\nsamba\nare suffixed with\n“-raw”\n. For example, if a windows user prints to\n\\\\rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\\cmpt-faculty\n, samba sends the job to the\ncmpt-faculty-raw\nCUPS queue. This is because the non-raw CUPS queues use\npostscript drivers\n, whereas the samba printers use\nPCL\ndrivers, and they are incompatible with each other.\nSFU_Print\nSFU_Print\nis a service used to print to the\nRicoh multi-function devices\nlocated in various places across the campus. This talks to a Windows PaperCut server which is independent from the RCG Print servers. Print jobs sent to\nSFU_Print\nbypass the RCG CUPS and Samba servers.\nPrinting from Linux to CUPS Print Queues\nIn versions of Linux that run older versions of\nCUPS\nsuch as CentOS 5 (\nCUPS 1.3\n) and CentOS 6 (\nCUPS 1.4\n) we use\n“BrowsePoll”\nto automatically get a list of all the printers on the RCG CUPS servers.\nUnfortunately, the developers of\nCUPS\n, in their misguided zealotry, decided to drop\n“BrowsePoll”\nin\nCUPS 1.6\nand above. This includes newer Linux versions such as CentOS 7. Fortunately, good people in the open source community developed\n“cups-browsed”\nwhich has similar functionality, and we use that on CentOS 7 and above to automatically populate the list of printers.\nTo see what printers are available, just type:\nlpstat -a\nYou should see a list of all the CUPS printers on\nrcga-blubell.dc.sfu.ca\n, depending on how the Linux computer has been configured.\nTo print a pdf file such as “filename.pdf”, to a printer such as “cmpt-faculty” on the Linux command-line, then type:\nlp -d cmpt-faculty filename.pdf\nAnd to check the status of your print job, point your web browser to:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/cmpt-faculty\nIf you want to cancel your job, just hit the “Cancel Job” button. You’ll be prompted to authenticate. Use your campus computing account name and password.\nIf you’re using the GUI on a Linux Workstation, the “Print” menu of the applications should see the same list of printers as\nlpstat -a\n.\nPrinting from Linux to SFU_Print\nYou can print to SFU_Print from the command-line of the RCG Linux terminal server\nrcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca\nin SFU Cloud. (See\nRCG Linux Terminal Server in SFU Cloud\nfor more details about this server.)\nIf you type:\nlpstat -a\nyou’ll see a list of all the CUPS printers on\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\n, and additionally you’ll see extras like these:\nSFU_Print accepting requests since Fri 31 Jan 2020 03:22:02 PM PST\nSFU_Print-colour accepting requests since Wed 29 Jan 2020 10:49:17 PM PST\nSFU_Print-colour-single accepting requests since Wed 29 Jan 2020 10:58:47 PM PST\nSFU_Print-single accepting requests since Wed 29 Jan 2020 10:45:23 PM PST\nThese four SFU_Print queues serve the following purposes:\nSFU_Print queue\nPurpose\nSFU_Print\nblack&white 2-sided printing\nSFU_Print-single\nblack&white 1-sided printing\nSFU_Print-colour\ncolour 2-sided printing\nSFU_Print-colour-single\ncolour 1-sided printing\nTo print a pdf file, say, “filename.pdf” to, say, SFU_Print-colour, just type the following:\nlp -d SFU_Print-colour filename.pdf\nThis will work only if you have a valid\nKerberos Ticket\n. If you log into\nrcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca\nusing your password, you’ll automatically get a\nKerberos Ticket\nupon login. However, if you use SSH public/private key exchange to log in without a password, that’ll bypass Kerberos Ticket creation and you’ll have to get one manually by typing:\nkinit\nFor more information about\nKerberos\n, please see our\nKerberos FAQ for Linux Workstation Users\n.\nIf you type:\nlpstat -o\nand you still see your job listed, as in:\nSFU_Print-colour-42 username 302080 Thu 06 Feb 2020 04:09:44 PM PST\nthat means that your print job\ndid not make it to SFU_Print\n, probably because you\ndidn’t have a valid Kerberos Ticket\n. You’ll need to cancel the stuck print job, using the\ncancel\ncommand, as in:\ncancel SFU_Print-colour-42\nand then\nkinit\nto get a\nKerberos Ticket\n, and then try printing again.\nPlease note that, by default,\nKerberos Tickets expire after 10 hours\n. If you want, you can set up a\ncron job\nto auto-renew your Kerberos Tickets. For details on this, please see\nQ #21: Help! I run long-term processes on my Linux Workstation and Kerberos is locking my home directory!\n.\nHowever, this will only work for a maximum of one week. If you want Kerberos to work indefinitely without having to manually\nkinit\n, you can set up your own\nprivate keytab file\n. For details on this, please see\nQ #22: The answer to Q #21 isn’t good enough! I need my processes to run unattended for weeks!\n.\n(For those of you who dont like the Unix System V print commands\nlp\n,\nlpstat\n,\ncancel\n, etc, the old Berkeley Unix print commands\nlpr\n,\nlpq\n,\nlprm\n, etc, are also available.)\nPaperCut\nPaperCut is the software that looks after page accounting for the SFU_Print system on campus. If you are using a Managed Desktop on campus, be it Linux, Mac, or Windows, it may be running a PaperCut Client App for SFU_Print. Here’s what it looks like on a Linux GNOME desktop:\nYou don’t need to run the PaperCut Client App when printing to SFU_Print from the command-line of rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca with Kerberos authentication. Printing will work fine without it.\nHowever, if the PaperCut Client App is running when you print from the command-line of rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca to SFU_Print with Kerberos authentication, then a PaperCut window will pop-up with a notification that your print job is waiting for you to release it. Here’s what it looks like on a Linux GNOME desktop:\nIf you see this window, that means your print job was successful, and that all you have to do is go to the printer and tap your key fob to the sensor in order to release your printing. If you don’t have a key fob, you can type in your Campus username and password on the printer’s LCD screen.\nNote that you don’t need to have the PaperCut Client running on the computer from which you print to SFU_Print. For example, you can print to SFU_Print from the command-line of rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca, which you ssh’d into from a Macintosh Desktop, and if the PaperCut Client App is running on your Mac the notification window will pop up there. (And if you are logged into more than one desktop computer with PaperCut Client Apps running, then PaperCut appears to choose at random which one to notify. It doesn’t notify more than one.)\nPrinting from Mac OS X\nMac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and below came installed with\nCUPS 1.4\nand below. This meant that printing worked much the same as on Linux.\nNewer versions of Mac OS X come installed with newer versions of\nCUPS\nfor which\n“BrowsePoll”\nhas been dropped. Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t have the open source\n“cups-browsed”\noption that Linux has. Apple’s focus in recent years has been to make things easier for home users who print directly to their printers, at the expense of enterprise-level systems administrators who want their users to print via a print server.\nThanks, Apple!\n:-(\nThis means that printers need to be manually managed on newer versions of Mac OS X. If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, here’s how:\n1.\nDon’t\nuse Apple’s Print GUI to add printers! You’ll see a list of printers on the network broadcasting their names via “Bonjour”. If you try to add one of these printers, they\nwon’t work\n! You need to use the print server.\n2. Point your web browser to\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/\nin order to see what printers are available. Pick out a printer that you want to add. For illustration, suppose it is the “ensc1” printer, which is an HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819.\nAssuming you have admin access to your Mac, open a Terminal and type the following:\nsudo /usr/sbin/lpadmin -p ensc1 -v ipp://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca/printers/ensc1 -D \"ensc1: HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819\" -L \"ASB 9819\" -E\nThe ensc1 printer will now be available for printing to.\n(The\n“-v”\nstring and the\n‘-E’\nare important. You can use whatever you want for the\n“-D”\nand\n“-L”\nstrings. See\nman lpadmin\nfor more details.)\nNOTE 1:\nThe printer shows up on the command-line as what you named it in the\n“-p”\noption. However, in the Mac OS X GUI, the printer shows up as what you gave in the\n“-D”\noption. Therefore it is a good idea to prefix the\n“-D”\ndescription string with the\n“-p”\nprinter name so as to avoid confusion. In the above example, the\n“-p”\nprinter name is\n“ensc1”\n, and it will show up in the Mac GUI as\n“ensc1: HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819”\n.\nNOTE 2:\nThe aforementioned method adds the printer without a local\n.ppd\nfile. In the past, this worked fine because all the information contained in the\n.ppd\nfile comes from the CUPS server. These days, however, some software (notoriously\nAdobe\nsoftware)\nwon’t print without a local ``.ppd`` file\n! In this case you need to setup the printer with a local\n.ppd\nfile like this:\nsudo /usr/sbin/lpadmin -p ensc1 -v ipp://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca/printers/ensc1 -m \"/Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/HP LaserJet P3010 Series.gz\" -D \"ensc1: HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819\" -L \"ASB 9819\" -E\n(This is assuming, of course, that you’ve installed the\nHPPrinterDrivers\npackage on your Mac.)\nAlternatively, you can ask us in the Research Computing Group to run script to add all the printers in your department/group/school.\nOnce you’ve printed a job to, say, the ensc1 printer via the Mac GUI, you can check its status by pointing your web browser to:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/ensc1\nIf you want to cancel your job, just hit the “Cancel Job” button. You’ll be prompted to authenticate. Use your campus computing account name and password.\nIf, at some point, a printer becomes obsolete and is removed from the\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nprint server, you’ll need to manually remove it from your Mac. Here’s how, assuming that the dead printer you want to get rid of is “ensc1”:\nsudo /usr/sbin/lpadmin -x ensc1\nPrinting from Windows\nThe Windows printer shares come from\n\\\\rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\\\n.\nYour department/group/school might have a Windows\nGroup Policy Object\nin\nActive Directory\nthat automatically deploys printer shares from our Samba server, in which case the printers automagically appear when you log-in.\nIf you need to manually add a printer, here’s how:\nOpen up\n“Devices & Printers”\nin the Windows Control Panel.\nHit\n“Add a printer”\n.\n3. The computer will start scanning for printers. Don’t bother waiting! Just hit\n“The printer that I want isn’t listed”\n. This will bring up the\n“Add Printer”\ndialog box.\n4. Hit\n“Select a shared printer by name”\n, and type\n\\\\rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\\\ninto the field, but\ndon’t\nhit “Enter” yet. Just wait long enough, and eventually a drop-down menu will appear showing all the Samba print shares on\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\n. Select the printer you want and then hit “Next”. For illustration, suppose it is the “cmpt-t9201” printer.\n5. The first time you do this, the printer driver will be downloaded from\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\n. (For “cmpt-t9201”, it is “HP Universal Printing PCL6”, version 6.8.0.24296.) You will need admin access to install the driver. (One advantage of using a Group Policy Object is that the drivers are automatically downloaded and installed without requiring admin access.)\nThe cmpt-t9201 printer will now be available in the Windows GUI for printing to. Unless the driver install failed. This might happen if you’re using a laptop that hasn’t been joined to the ADSFU domain, because by default Windows 10 comes with “\nPoint and Print Restrictions\n” that block print drivers from being installed. If you want to fix this, open a Command Prompt on your Windows computer and type:\ngpedit\nThis will bring up the Local Group Policy Editor. Then go to:\nComputer Configuration:Administrative Templates:Printers\nto find the “\nPoint and Print Restrictions\n” policy and disable it. (Or at least open it up to our Samba server\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\n.)\nFor good measure, you should also disable the “\nAlways render print jobs on server\n” policy as well. The Samba server doesn’t render print jobs.\nOnce you’ve printed a job to the cmpt-t9201 printer via the Windows GUI, you can check its status by pointing your web browser to:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/cmpt-t9201\nIf you want to cancel your job, just hit the “Cancel Job” button. You’ll be prompted to authenticate. Use your campus computing account name and password.\nPrinter Access Control\nThere are two types of access control that we use for printers:\nhost\nand\nuser\n.\nAs mentioned above, the printers that are managed by us are, in general, blocked from direct printing. In other words, only a small set of\nhosts\n(namely, the print servers and other administrative servers) are allowed to access the printers via the network.\nAdditionally,\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nis able to restrict specific printers to specific\nuser groups\n(or SFU\nmaillists\n). If you are a Lab Administrator and want your Lab Printer restricted to members of your Lab, please let us know at\nresearch-support@sfu.ca\n, and we will be happy to set this up for you.\nSFU_Print\nhas its own access control system that is independent from the Research Computing Group. Contact\nits-papercut-help@sfu.ca\nfor more information.\nPrinter Accounting\nThe\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nprint server logs all print jobs, and once per month an accounting summary for each printer is automatically e-mailed to corresponding Lab Administrators and/or Departmental Administrators.\nAdditionally, some printers have a per-user page quota in order to restrict overuse. If you are a Lab Administrator and want your Lab Printer to have quotas, please let us know at\nresearch-support@sfu.ca\n, and we will be happy to set this up for you.",

    "clean_body_text": "Research\nResearch-Specific Computing and Applications\nWorkstation Help\nConnectivity\nThe printers that are managed by the Research Computing Group are, with few exceptions, blocked from direct printing. Printers like to advertise their presence on the network with various broadcast protocols that your computer might recognize. However, if you attempt to print to them, your printing will, in general, fail. Because printers consume real resources that cost money, we like to keep track of who prints how much. For that reason, we use print servers. Only the print servers are allowed to print directly to printers, and users must print via the print servers.\nRCG PRINT SERVER IN SFU CLOUD\nThis new RCG\nCUPS\nand\nsamba\nserver was set up in the fall of 2019:\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nThis is a VM running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and it exists within a VMware NSX environment known as “SFU Cloud”, physically located in the Water Tower Data Centre at SFU Burnaby.\nOLD RCG PRINT SERVER\nThis old RCG\nCUPS\nand\nSamba\nserver was\nretired on July 17th, 2020\n, and it will not be coming back:\nrcg-bluebell.rcg.sfu.ca\nThis VM was running the very old CentOS 6 Linux. It existed on a KVM hypervisor located in SFU Burnaby’s TASC 2 server room which suffered a power distribution meltdown on the night of July 16th, 2020.\nWHAT IS CUPS?\nCUPS\nis the “Common Unix Printing System”, used by most Linux distributions and Mac OS X. This is what queues the print jobs on\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nand sends them to the printers. It also keeps track of who prints how many pages.\nIf you want to see what printers are available and what their status is, point your web browser here:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/\nNote that for security reasons, this URL will only work on-campus and not remotely.\nIf you get a certificate warning, you should download and install the RCG CA Certificate. For details, please see our SSL documentation.\nIf you want to see what print jobs are sitting in the queue, point your web browser here:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/jobs/\nIf you want to cancel your print job, you need to log-in using your campus computing account name and password.\nWHAT IS SAMBA?\nSamba\nis used to re-share the\nCUPS\nprinters to Windows computers. Windows computers print to\nsamba\nprinter shares on:\n\\\\rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\\\nand then\nsamba\nsends the print job into the corresponding\nCUPS\nqueue. To check the status of your print job, or to cancel it, use the aforementioned URLs.\nNOTE\n: On the new\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nserver, the\nCUPS\nqueues names used by\nsamba\nare suffixed with\n“-raw”\n. For example, if a windows user prints to\n\\\\rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\\cmpt-faculty\n, samba sends the job to the\ncmpt-faculty-raw\nCUPS queue. This is because the non-raw CUPS queues use\npostscript drivers\n, whereas the samba printers use\nPCL\ndrivers, and they are incompatible with each other.\nSFU_PRINT\nSFU_Print\nis a service used to print to the\nRicoh multi-function devices\nlocated in various places across the campus. This talks to a Windows PaperCut server which is independent from the RCG Print servers. Print jobs sent to\nSFU_Print\nbypass the RCG CUPS and Samba servers.\nPRINTING FROM LINUX TO CUPS PRINT QUEUES\nIn versions of Linux that run older versions of\nCUPS\nsuch as CentOS 5 (\nCUPS 1.3\n) and CentOS 6 (\nCUPS 1.4\n) we use\n“BrowsePoll”\nto automatically get a list of all the printers on the RCG CUPS servers.\nUnfortunately, the developers of\nCUPS\n, in their misguided zealotry, decided to drop\n“BrowsePoll”\nin\nCUPS 1.6\nand above. This includes newer Linux versions such as CentOS 7. Fortunately, good people in the open source community developed\n“cups-browsed”\nwhich has similar functionality, and we use that on CentOS 7 and above to automatically populate the list of printers.\nTo see what printers are available, just type:\nlpstat -a\nYou should see a list of all the CUPS printers on\nrcga-blubell.dc.sfu.ca\n, depending on how the Linux computer has been configured.\nTo print a pdf file such as “filename.pdf”, to a printer such as “cmpt-faculty” on the Linux command-line, then type:\nlp -d cmpt-faculty filename.pdf\nAnd to check the status of your print job, point your web browser to:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/cmpt-faculty\nIf you want to cancel your job, just hit the “Cancel Job” button. You’ll be prompted to authenticate. Use your campus computing account name and password.\nIf you’re using the GUI on a Linux Workstation, the “Print” menu of the applications should see the same list of printers as\nlpstat -a\n.\nPRINTING FROM LINUX TO SFU_PRINT\nYou can print to SFU_Print from the command-line of the RCG Linux terminal server\nrcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca\nin SFU Cloud. (See\nRCG Linux Terminal Server in SFU Cloud\nfor more details about this server.)\nIf you type:\nlpstat -a\nyou’ll see a list of all the CUPS printers on\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\n, and additionally you’ll see extras like these:\nSFU_Print accepting requests since Fri 31 Jan 2020 03:22:02 PM PST\nSFU_Print-colour accepting requests since Wed 29 Jan 2020 10:49:17 PM PST\nSFU_Print-colour-single accepting requests since Wed 29 Jan 2020 10:58:47 PM PST\nSFU_Print-single accepting requests since Wed 29 Jan 2020 10:45:23 PM PST\nThese four SFU_Print queues serve the following purposes:\nSFU_Print queue\nPurpose\nSFU_Print\nblack&white 2-sided printing\nSFU_Print-single\nblack&white 1-sided printing\nSFU_Print-colour\ncolour 2-sided printing\nSFU_Print-colour-single\ncolour 1-sided printing\nTo print a pdf file, say, “filename.pdf” to, say, SFU_Print-colour, just type the following:\nlp -d SFU_Print-colour filename.pdf\nThis will work only if you have a valid\nKerberos Ticket\n. If you log into\nrcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca\nusing your password, you’ll automatically get a\nKerberos Ticket\nupon login. However, if you use SSH public/private key exchange to log in without a password, that’ll bypass Kerberos Ticket creation and you’ll have to get one manually by typing:\nkinit\nFor more information about\nKerberos\n, please see our\nKerberos FAQ for Linux Workstation Users\n.\nIf you type:\nlpstat -o\nand you still see your job listed, as in:\nSFU_Print-colour-42 username 302080 Thu 06 Feb 2020 04:09:44 PM PST\nthat means that your print job\ndid not make it to SFU_Print\n, probably because you\ndidn’t have a valid Kerberos Ticket\n. You’ll need to cancel the stuck print job, using the\ncancel\ncommand, as in:\ncancel SFU_Print-colour-42\nand then\nkinit\nto get a\nKerberos Ticket\n, and then try printing again.\nPlease note that, by default,\nKerberos Tickets expire after 10 hours\n. If you want, you can set up a\ncron job\nto auto-renew your Kerberos Tickets. For details on this, please see\nQ #21: Help! I run long-term processes on my Linux Workstation and Kerberos is locking my home directory!\n.\nHowever, this will only work for a maximum of one week. If you want Kerberos to work indefinitely without having to manually\nkinit\n, you can set up your own\nprivate keytab file\n. For details on this, please see\nQ #22: The answer to Q #21 isn’t good enough! I need my processes to run unattended for weeks!\n.\n(For those of you who dont like the Unix System V print commands\nlp\n,\nlpstat\n,\ncancel\n, etc, the old Berkeley Unix print commands\nlpr\n,\nlpq\n,\nlprm\n, etc, are also available.)\nPAPERCUT\nPaperCut is the software that looks after page accounting for the SFU_Print system on campus. If you are using a Managed Desktop on campus, be it Linux, Mac, or Windows, it may be running a PaperCut Client App for SFU_Print. Here’s what it looks like on a Linux GNOME desktop:\nYou don’t need to run the PaperCut Client App when printing to SFU_Print from the command-line of rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca with Kerberos authentication. Printing will work fine without it.\nHowever, if the PaperCut Client App is running when you print from the command-line of rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca to SFU_Print with Kerberos authentication, then a PaperCut window will pop-up with a notification that your print job is waiting for you to release it. Here’s what it looks like on a Linux GNOME desktop:\nIf you see this window, that means your print job was successful, and that all you have to do is go to the printer and tap your key fob to the sensor in order to release your printing. If you don’t have a key fob, you can type in your Campus username and password on the printer’s LCD screen.\nNote that you don’t need to have the PaperCut Client running on the computer from which you print to SFU_Print. For example, you can print to SFU_Print from the command-line of rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca, which you ssh’d into from a Macintosh Desktop, and if the PaperCut Client App is running on your Mac the notification window will pop up there. (And if you are logged into more than one desktop computer with PaperCut Client Apps running, then PaperCut appears to choose at random which one to notify. It doesn’t notify more than one.)\nPRINTING FROM MAC OS X\nMac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and below came installed with\nCUPS 1.4\nand below. This meant that printing worked much the same as on Linux.\nNewer versions of Mac OS X come installed with newer versions of\nCUPS\nfor which\n“BrowsePoll”\nhas been dropped. Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t have the open source\n“cups-browsed”\noption that Linux has. Apple’s focus in recent years has been to make things easier for home users who print directly to their printers, at the expense of enterprise-level systems administrators who want their users to print via a print server.\nThanks, Apple!\n:-(\nThis means that printers need to be manually managed on newer versions of Mac OS X. If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, here’s how:\n1.\nDon’t\nuse Apple’s Print GUI to add printers! You’ll see a list of printers on the network broadcasting their names via “Bonjour”. If you try to add one of these printers, they\nwon’t work\n! You need to use the print server.\n2. Point your web browser to\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/\nin order to see what printers are available. Pick out a printer that you want to add. For illustration, suppose it is the “ensc1” printer, which is an HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819.\nAssuming you have admin access to your Mac, open a Terminal and type the following:\nsudo /usr/sbin/lpadmin -p ensc1 -v ipp://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca/printers/ensc1 -D \"ensc1: HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819\" -L \"ASB 9819\" -E\nThe ensc1 printer will now be available for printing to.\n(The\n“-v”\nstring and the\n‘-E’\nare important. You can use whatever you want for the\n“-D”\nand\n“-L”\nstrings. See\nman lpadmin\nfor more details.)\nNOTE 1:\nThe printer shows up on the command-line as what you named it in the\n“-p”\noption. However, in the Mac OS X GUI, the printer shows up as what you gave in the\n“-D”\noption. Therefore it is a good idea to prefix the\n“-D”\ndescription string with the\n“-p”\nprinter name so as to avoid confusion. In the above example, the\n“-p”\nprinter name is\n“ensc1”\n, and it will show up in the Mac GUI as\n“ensc1: HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819”\n.\nNOTE 2:\nThe aforementioned method adds the printer without a local\n.ppd\nfile. In the past, this worked fine because all the information contained in the\n.ppd\nfile comes from the CUPS server. These days, however, some software (notoriously\nAdobe\nsoftware)\nwon’t print without a local ``.ppd`` file\n! In this case you need to setup the printer with a local\n.ppd\nfile like this:\nsudo /usr/sbin/lpadmin -p ensc1 -v ipp://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca/printers/ensc1 -m \"/Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/HP LaserJet P3010 Series.gz\" -D \"ensc1: HP LaserJet P3015 in ASB 9819\" -L \"ASB 9819\" -E\n(This is assuming, of course, that you’ve installed the\nHPPrinterDrivers\npackage on your Mac.)\nAlternatively, you can ask us in the Research Computing Group to run script to add all the printers in your department/group/school.\nOnce you’ve printed a job to, say, the ensc1 printer via the Mac GUI, you can check its status by pointing your web browser to:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/ensc1\nIf you want to cancel your job, just hit the “Cancel Job” button. You’ll be prompted to authenticate. Use your campus computing account name and password.\nIf, at some point, a printer becomes obsolete and is removed from the\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nprint server, you’ll need to manually remove it from your Mac. Here’s how, assuming that the dead printer you want to get rid of is “ensc1”:\nsudo /usr/sbin/lpadmin -x ensc1\nPRINTING FROM WINDOWS\nThe Windows printer shares come from\n\\\\rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\\\n.\nYour department/group/school might have a Windows\nGroup Policy Object\nin\nActive Directory\nthat automatically deploys printer shares from our Samba server, in which case the printers automagically appear when you log-in.\nIf you need to manually add a printer, here’s how:\nOpen up\n“Devices & Printers”\nin the Windows Control Panel.\nHit\n“Add a printer”\n.\n3. The computer will start scanning for printers. Don’t bother waiting! Just hit\n“The printer that I want isn’t listed”\n. This will bring up the\n“Add Printer”\ndialog box.\n4. Hit\n“Select a shared printer by name”\n, and type\n\\\\rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\\\ninto the field, but\ndon’t\nhit “Enter” yet. Just wait long enough, and eventually a drop-down menu will appear showing all the Samba print shares on\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\n. Select the printer you want and then hit “Next”. For illustration, suppose it is the “cmpt-t9201” printer.\n5. The first time you do this, the printer driver will be downloaded from\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\n. (For “cmpt-t9201”, it is “HP Universal Printing PCL6”, version 6.8.0.24296.) You will need admin access to install the driver. (One advantage of using a Group Policy Object is that the drivers are automatically downloaded and installed without requiring admin access.)\nThe cmpt-t9201 printer will now be available in the Windows GUI for printing to. Unless the driver install failed. This might happen if you’re using a laptop that hasn’t been joined to the ADSFU domain, because by default Windows 10 comes with “\nPoint and Print Restrictions\n” that block print drivers from being installed. If you want to fix this, open a Command Prompt on your Windows computer and type:\ngpedit\nThis will bring up the Local Group Policy Editor. Then go to:\nComputer Configuration:Administrative Templates:Printers\nto find the “\nPoint and Print Restrictions\n” policy and disable it. (Or at least open it up to our Samba server\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\n.)\nFor good measure, you should also disable the “\nAlways render print jobs on server\n” policy as well. The Samba server doesn’t render print jobs.\nOnce you’ve printed a job to the cmpt-t9201 printer via the Windows GUI, you can check its status by pointing your web browser to:\nhttps://rcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca:8008/printers/cmpt-t9201\nIf you want to cancel your job, just hit the “Cancel Job” button. You’ll be prompted to authenticate. Use your campus computing account name and password.\nPRINTER ACCESS CONTROL\nThere are two types of access control that we use for printers:\nhost\nand\nuser\n.\nAs mentioned above, the printers that are managed by us are, in general, blocked from direct printing. In other words, only a small set of\nhosts\n(namely, the print servers and other administrative servers) are allowed to access the printers via the network.\nAdditionally,\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nis able to restrict specific printers to specific\nuser groups\n(or SFU\nmaillists\n). If you are a Lab Administrator and want your Lab Printer restricted to members of your Lab, please let us know at\nresearch-support@sfu.ca\n, and we will be happy to set this up for you.\nSFU_Print\nhas its own access control system that is independent from the Research Computing Group. Contact\nits-papercut-help@sfu.ca\nfor more information.\nPRINTER ACCOUNTING\nThe\nrcga-bluebell.dc.sfu.ca\nprint server logs all print jobs, and once per month an accounting summary for each printer is automatically e-mailed to corresponding Lab Administrators and/or Departmental Administrators.\nAdditionally, some printers have a per-user page quota in order to restrict overuse. If you are a Lab Administrator and want your Lab Printer to have quotas, please let us know at\nresearch-support@sfu.ca\n, and we will be happy to set this up for you.",

The one you used for\nCentOS\nwill\nnot\nwork for\nUbuntu\n. Here’s what we recommend as a bare minimum for the contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxrdb $HOME/.Xresources\nxsetroot -solid grey\n# Fix to make GNOME work\nexport XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\nunset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\nmate-session &\nIf you are met with a grey screen instead of MATE Desktop, ensure your xstartup file is executable:\n$ chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup\nIf you want to load some modules into your MATE session so that they will automatically be loaded in all shells, then use something akin to the following. This example is with the LANG/PYTHON/3.5.2-SYSTEM module:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxrdb $HOME/.Xresources\nxsetroot -solid grey\n# Fix to make GNOME work\nexport XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\nunset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\n. /etc/profile.d/modules_environment.sh\nmodule load LANG/PYTHON/3.5.2-SYSTEM\nmate-session &\nNOTE: if you use VNC to connect to both\nCentOS\nand\nUbuntu\nservers, then you’ll need to write some code into your xstartup file to autodetect the Linux distro and act accordingly.\nStep #2: Set A VNC Password\nMake sure you set a VNC password with the\nvncpasswd\ncommand.\nStep #3: Start The VNC Server\nssh into the Ubuntu Linux server and type:\nvncserver\nIt will start up the stuff in your .vnc/xstartup file and will respond with something like:\nNew 'X' desktop is myserver.mydomain.sfu.ca:n\nwhere myserver.mydomain.sfu.ca is the server’s hostname and n is the virtual desktop number. Remember this number. The tcp port number used by VNC will be 5900+n. You can now log out of the server. The vnc session will remain running, virtually forever, until the server gets rebooted or you ssh in and issue:\nvncserver -kill :n\n(where n is the virtual desktop number)\nStep #4: Tunnel VNC Via SSH\nNEVER\nconnect directly to the VNC port! This is a security risk!\ntightvnc, which is the default VNC packaged with Ubuntu 16, does\nnot\nsupport encryption and therefore all packets sent over the internet without being tunneled via SSH are open to snooping. Although some VNC clients, such as RealVNC on Windows do support encryption, it won’t help if the server doesn’t!\nIn order to protect users from this risk, we firewall the VNC ports on Ubuntu servers. You therefore\nmust\ntunnel the VNC ports via SSH.\n(Those of you who used VNC with CentOS 6 servers might have avoided tunneling because the default VNC packaged with CentOS 6 is tigervnc, which does support encryption.)\nSSH tunneling is easily done on the command-line of any\nLinux\nor\nMac\nworkstation.\nOn a\nWindows\nworkstation, you can set up SSH tunneling via\nPuTTY\n, but we recommend\nMobaXterm\nbecause then the instructions are exactly the same as for Linux and Mac.\nIf your\nWindows\nworkstation doesn’t have\nMobaXterm\n, you can download the home edition for free from:\nhttp://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html\nOn your client workstation or home computer, you’ll need to open 2\nLinux\nshells, or 2\nMac\nTerminals or 2\nMobaXterm\nwindows. Choose an unused TCP port on your client workstation that you’d like to use to tunnel SSH to your VNC server on. Let’s say it’s 9999. Suppose that your VNC server’s hostname is “myserver.mydomain.sfu.ca” and that your username is “user”. In Terminal 1, type:\nssh -L 9999:myserver.mydomain.sfu.ca:22 user@rcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca\nand log into rcga-linux-ts1. Now port 9999 on your client workstation or home computer talks to port 22 on your VNC server via our Linux Terminal Server. Let’s suppose that your VNC server is using virtual desktop number 4. That means that it’s listening on TCP port 5904. In Terminal 2, type:\nssh -L 5904:127.0.0.1:5904 -p 9999 user@127.0.0.1\nand log into 127.0.0.1 (which is actually myserver.mydomain.sfu.ca.) This will tunnel port 5904 on your home computer or client workstation to port 5904 on your VNC server (through the port 9999 tunnel that you set up).\nNOTE that you\nmust\ntunnel via\nrcga-linux-ts1.dc.sfu.ca\nif you are off campus or on wireless, because direct SSH access to hosts on campus is in general blocked (and so are the VNC ports).\nStep #5: Connect Your VNC Client To The Local End Of The Tunnel\nAssuming your virtual desktop is\n4\n, connect your VNC client to\n127.0.0.1:4\n. This is the local end of the tunnel. Use your VNC password set in step #2. The data will be fully encrypted via ssh all the way to your VNC server.\nStep #6: Kill Your VNC Server Sessions When You’re Done With Them\nPlease kill your old vncserver sessions with\nvncserver -kill :n\nwhen you are done with them. Don’t just start new ones! (We’ve seen some users with dozens of vnc sessions running on the same server! You only need one!)\nIf you’re not sure, take a look at the process table with\nps -ef | grep -i vnc",

It allows you to use the same home directory on any Linux machine on the Campus wired network.\nNFSv4\nrefers to version 4 of this Network File System, which allows for\nKerberization\n.\nQ #3: What Is Kerberization?\nKerberization\nis the process by which\nis enabled on your Linux\nNFSv4\nhome directory (and other things), such that nobody can view its contents without a\nKerberos Ticket\n.\nQ #4: What Is A Kerberos Ticket?\nA\nKerberos Ticket\nis a chunk of encrypted data that gives you access to things on the Campus wired network such as your\nNFSv4\nhome directory.\nQ #5: How Do I Get A Kerberos Ticket?\nUpon successfully logging in to a Linux Workstation on the Campus wired network, you will (if the system is working correctly) automatically be issued a\nKerberos Ticket\nknown as a\n“Ticket Granting Ticket”\n. This ticket is then used to gain access to other things, such as your Linux\nNFSv4\nhome directory. Each such thing you access causes a new\nKerberos Ticket\nto be generated, specific to the service you’re accessing.\nQ #6: How Long Does A Kerberos Ticket Last?\nBy default, all\nKerberos Tickets\nhave a\n10 hour lifetime\nbefore they expire, and a\nmaximum renewal period of 1 week\n. If you want to renew your ticket, you must do so\nbefore it expires\n. If you wait until\nafter\nthe 10 hours is up, then it is too late, and you must\nget a new one\n.\nQ #7: What Happens When My Kerberos Ticket Expires?\nYou\nlose acceess to your home directory\n.\nYou will regain access to your home directory when you get a new\nKerberos Ticket\n.\nQ #8: How Do I Renew My Kerberos Ticket Before It Expires?\nSee\nQ #13\nor\nQ #23\n.\nQ #9: How Do I Get A New Kerberos Ticket After My Old One Expires?\nSee\nQ #14\nor\nQ #23\n.\nQ #10: Do I Need To Worry About Kerberos On Linux Servers?\nOn many Linux Servers, your\nNFSv4\nhome directory is mounted\nwithout Kerberization\n.\nThis includes all the\nColony Cluster nodes\n. Cluster jobs may run for weeks or sometimes months. We wouldn’t want you to have to renew your Kerberos Ticket every 10 hours in order to keep your jobs running!\nMost other Linux Servers, including the\nLinux terminal servers (rcg-linux-ts1.rcg.sfu.ca & rcg-linux-ts2.rcg.sfu.ca)\n,\nwill use Kerberization\n, with the exception of\nrcg-linux-ts3.rcg.sfu.ca\n, which we are providing without Kerberization for the convenience of those users who need to run long-term jobs, such as\nscreen\nor\ntmux\n.\nQ #11: Why Do We Have To Suffer The Inconvenience Of Kerberos On Linux Workstations?\nNon-Kerberized NFS\nis inherently\ninsecure\n, in that anybody with sudo access to a Linux computer can\nsu\nto another user and read/modify the contents of their home directory.\nMost of our Linux Servers are locked up in a server room with restricted physical access, and only trusted IT staff have sudo access. This minimizes the risk and therefore we can allow many of these servers to use\nnon-Kerberized NFS\n.\nThe Linux Workstations, on the other hand, have a more liberal policy with regards to who is granted sudo access. This is because Faculty members often demand sudo access to their own Workstations, and Lab Administrators of various research labs need to install software for their users. In order to accomodate this greater risk, we need to use\nKerberized NFSv4\non all the Linux Workstations.\nLINUX COMMAND-LINE KERBEROS QUESTIONS\nQ #12: How Do I View My Kerberos Tickets?\nJust type:\nklist\nYou’ll see something akin to the following:\nTicket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_12345_A6b7C8\nDefault principal: username@AD.SFU.CA\n\nValid starting Expires Service principal\n05/02/20 15:29:10 06/02/20 01:29:10 krbtgt/AD.SFU.CA@AD.SFU.CA\nrenew until 12/02/20 15:27:42\non computers that use a file-based\nKerberos Ticket cache\n.\nIf the computer is using the\nkernel keyring\nfor kerberos tickets, then you’ll see something akin to the following:\nTicket cache: KEYRING:persistent:12345:krb_ccache_4Ybfz5f\nDefault principal: username@AD.SFU.CA\n\nValid starting Expires Service principal\n05/02/20 15:29:10 06/02/20 01:29:10 krbtgt/AD.SFU.CA@AD.SFU.CA\nrenew until 12/02/20 15:27:42\nIn either case,\nkrbtgt\nis the\nKerberos Ticket Granting Ticket\n. You’ll see that it was valid starting at 15:29 on Feb 5th, 2020, and it\nexpires 10 hours later\n.\nYou’ll also see that it can be\nrenewed\nfor up to a week before you need to get a new Kerberos ticket. However, it must be renewed\nbefore it expires\n. If you wait until\nafter\nthe 10 hours is up, then it is too late!\nIf you have accessed your Linux\nNFSv4\nhome directory, then might also see another\nKerberos Ticket\n:\n02/05/20 16:00:57 02/06/20 02:00:55 nfs/nfs-home.its.sfu.ca@AD.SFU.CA\nrenew until 02/12/20 16:00:51\nThis is the\nnfs\nKerberos Ticket that allows you to read and write to your home directory located on the\nnfs-home.its.sfu.ca\nserver.\nAnd if you used Kerberos authentication to ssh into a Linux host such as rcg-linux-ts1.rcg.sfu.ca, then you might also see a\nKerberos Ticket\nlike this:\n02/05/20 16:02:26 02/06/20 02:00:55 host/rcg-linux-ts1.rcg.sfu.ca@AD.SFU.CA\nrenew until 02/12/20 16:00:51\nThis is a\nhost\nKerberos Ticket.\nQ #13: How Do I Renew My Kerberos Tickets Before They Expire?\nJust type:\nkinit -R\nThis will renew your\nKerberos Ticket Granting Ticket\n. The other tickets will disappear. But that’s okay. New ones will be auto-generated when you access things such as your Linux NFSv4 home directory.\nQ #14: What Happens If I Forget To Renew My Kerberos Tickets Before They Expire?\nJust type:\nkinit\nand then give your password. You’ll get a new\nKerberos Ticket Granting Ticket\n.\nQ #15: What Happens To My Kerberos Tickets After The Maximum Renewal Period Has Passed?\nYour\nKerberos Tickets\ncannot be renewed after the maximum renewal period, which is\none week\n.\nBut you can always get a new one. Just type:\nkinit\nand then give your password. You’ll get a new\nKerberos Ticket Granting Ticket\n.\nQ #16: Help! I Can No Longer Access My Home Directory! Why?\nThis probably means that your\nKerberos Ticket\nexpired. A sign of this is that you type:\nls\nand the system responds with:\nls: cannot open directory '.': Key has expired\nAnother possibility is that your\nKerberos Ticket\nhas been destroyed and is no longer present. In which case the system responds with:\nls: cannot open directory '.': Permission denied\nIn any case, the fix is straightforward. Don’t panic! Just\nfeed the 3-headed dog\n. Its favourite food is\nkinit\n. Simply type:\nkinit\nand then give your password. You’ll get a new\nKerberos Ticket Granting Ticket\n.\nQ #17: Help! My Home Directory Isn’t Available At Login! Why?\nNormally, a\nKerberos Ticket\nis generated at login time. However, under some circumstances this doesn’t happen. Upon login you might see the following:\nCould not chdir to home directory /home/user: Key has expired\nor:\nCould not chdir to home directory /home/user: Permission denied\nThe first is an indication that you had a\nKerberos Ticket\nbut that it has expired.\nThe second is an indication that you don’t have a\nKerberos Ticket\nat all.\nEither of these error messages will immediately be followed by something like:\nLoading default RCG module...\nENVIRONMENTS/RCG(26):ERROR:102: Tcl command execution failed: set MACHINE_OSVER [exec facter lsbdistdescription]\n\nuse.own(49):ERROR:102: Tcl command execution failed: if [ module-info mode load ] {\nif { !

Don’t panic!\nThe 3-headed dog is hungry\n. Feed it with:\nkinit\nand then give your password. You’ll get a new\nKerberos Ticket Granting Ticket\n. Then\nlog out\nand\nlog in\nagain. This time, the login should proceed normally and the\nmodules environment\nwill be loaded as usual.\nWhy do these things sometimes happen?\nIt might be that you set up ssh public/private key exchange, in order to log in without giving a password. This may have worked fine in the past, but you can’t generate a\nKerberos Ticket\nwithout typing your password!\nQ #18: How Do I Destroy My Kerberos Tickets? Why Would I Want To?\nTo destroy your\nKerberos Tickets\n, just type:\nkdestroy\nIt is\nrecommended\nthat you do this before logging out of a Linux workstation.\nIf you fail to do this, any valid\nKerberos Tickets\nwill remain in the\nKerberos Ticket cache\n. On computers that are using file-based Kerberos Ticket caches, these will be files in /tmp. Anybody with sudo access to the Linux workstation could potentially use these these kerberos ticket cache files to access your home directory!\nEven if you do\nkdestroy\nthere are often other\nKerberos Ticket caches\nthat get generated by various activities. They may also be stored in /tmp. To be safe, it is best to take a look in /tmp and make sure that there are no files there belonging to you starting with\nkrb5cc_\n. If there are, delete them.\nQ #19: Why Can I Still Read My Home Directory After Destroying My Kerberos Tickets?\nkdestroy\nwill instantly remove your\nKerberos Tickets\nfrom a cache file in /tmp/. And\nrm /tmp/krb5cc_[your_uid]*\nwill remove other\nKerberos Tickets\nyou may have. However, the Linux kernel also caches\nKerberos Tickets\nin memory, and it takes a while before the memory cache is cleared.\nQ #20: How Do I Use Kerberos Authentication To Ssh Into A Linux Host?\nAssuming you are logged-into a Linux host on the Campus wired network and that you have a valid\nKerberos Ticket\n, you can ssh into any other such Linux host simply via:\nssh -K hostname.domainname\nUsing this method, you can log in without having to use a password. The advantage of this method over using ssh public/private key exchange is that your\nKerberos Ticket\nwill be propagated to the second host.\nQ #21: Help! I Run Long-Term Processes On My Linux Workstation And Kerberos Is Locking My Home Directory!\nIf you run long-term processes on your Linux Workstation and you don’t want to have to keep manually renewing your Kerberos tickets every 10 hours, you can set up a\ncron job\nto do it for you.\nIn order to do this, you need to edit your crontab with\ncrontab -e\n. Before doing so, make sure that your\nEDITOR\nenvironment variable is set to your favourite Linux editor. Eg.\nsetenv EDITOR emacs\nor\nsetenv EDITOR vim\n, assuming that your shell is tcsh (or export\nEDITOR=emacs\nor\nexport EDITOR=vim\n, if your shell is bash).\nFor example, you could set up the following crontab entry on your Linux computer:\nMAILTO=username@sfu.ca\n30 * * * * /usr/bin/kinit -R\nThis will renew your Kerberos ticket at 30 minutes past every hour of every day. (See\nman 5 crontab\nfor more information on what the various fields mean.)\nNote, however, that this will work for at most\n1 week\n, until the renewal period expires, and then one must manually\nkinit\nand type one’s password. This is where setting\nMAILTO=username@sfu.ca\ncomes in handy, because you will receive mail when the cron job fails. (Be sure to use your real username here, not “username”!)\nQ #22: The Answer To Q #21 Isn’t Good Enough! I Need My Processes To Run Unattended For Weeks!\nYou can achieve this via a\ncrontab\nentry and your own private\nkeytab\nfile.\nSuppose you want to keep your\nkeytab\nwithin your home directory in\n/home/username/myprivatestuff/username.keytab\n. You can create it as follows:\nmkdir myprivatestuff\nchmod 0700 myprivatestuff\ncd myprivatestuff\nktutil\naddent -password -p username@AD.SFU.CA -k 1 -e aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96\naddent -password -p username@AD.SFU.CA -k 1 -e aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96\n(enter your password here when asked)\nwkt username.keytab\nq\n(Make sure you use your real username here, not “username”!)\nYou can call the directory whatever you want; just\nmake sure it’s private\n– that’s what the\nchmod 0700\nis for. If somebody gains access to your keytab file then they can use it to\ngain access to all your stuff!\nYou can then set up a\ncrontab\nentry similar to the one above, but instead of using\nkinit -R\n, you use the following:\nMAILTO=username@sfu.ca\n* */2 * * * /usr/bin/kinit username@AD.SFU.CA -k -t /home/username/myprivatestuff/username.keytab\n(Again, make sure you use your real username here, not “username”!)\nThis will get you a new\nKerberos Ticket\nevery 2 hours, without having to type a password, by using the credentials stored in your private keytab file.\nThis will work\nvirtually forever\n* (until the computer reboots), unless for some reason the cron job fails for more than 10 hours and the\nKerberos Ticket\nexpires. In this case your home directory becomes unavailable, and the cron job can no longer read the contents of\n/home/username/privatestuff\n. It’s a bit of a catch-22, but one can get around it by manually typing\nkinit\nand giving one’s password.\nIf the computer is rebooted, then the\nKerberos Ticket caches\nget cleared, resulting in all the Kerberos tickets going away. Subsequent to a reboot, you need to\nkinit\nmanaully to get a new Kerberos ticket before your cron job will work.\n*\nvirtually forever\nunless one changes one’s Campus password, in which case the steps of creating a private keytab need to be redone.\nLINUX GUI KERBEROS QUESTIONS\nQ #23: How To I Renew My Kerberos Ticket In The Linux GUI?\nIf you’ve been away from your Linux workstation for a while, the screen saver kicks in and the screen is locked until you type your password. Every time you unlock your screen, a new Kerberos Ticket is generated.\nIf you’ve configured your workstation not to lock the screen (or if you’re using the Linux GUI via\nVNC\nwhich doesn’t usually lock the virtual screen), then your Kerberos Ticket will expire after 10 hours and you’ll notice that various things in the GUI will no longer work.\nYou should, however, still be able to open a Linux Terminal. For example, in Ubuntu’s MATE GUI, go to the\nApplications:System Tools\nmenu and select “\nMATE Terminal\n”:\nIt will load with error messages like this:\nLoading default RCG module...\nENVIRONMENTS/RCG(26):ERROR:102: Tcl command execution failed: set MACHINE_OSVER [exec facter lsbdistdescription]\n\nuse.own(49):ERROR:102: Tcl command execution failed: if [ module-info mode load ] {\nif { ! [ file exists $ownmoddir ] } {\nfile mkdir $ownmoddir\nset null [open $ownmoddir/null w]\nputs $null \"#%Module########################################################################\"\nputs $null \"##\"\nputs $null \"## null modulefile\"\nputs $null \"##\"\nputs $null \"proc ModulesHelp { } {\"\nputs $null \" global version\"\nputs $null \"\"\nputs $null \" puts stderr \\\"\\tThis module does absolutely nothing.\\\"\"\nputs $null \" puts stderr \\\"\\tIt's meant simply as a place holder in your\\\"\"\nputs $null \" puts stderr \\\"\\tdot file initialization.\\\"\"\nputs $null \" puts stderr \\\"\\n\\tVersion \\$version\\n\\\"\"\nputs $null \"}\"\nputs $null \"\"\nputs $null \"module-whatis \\\"does absolutely nothing\\\"\"\nputs $null \"\"\nputs $null \"# for Tcl script use only\"\nputs $null \"set version 3.2.10\"\n}\n}\nThis is an indication that the\nmodules environment\nhas failed to load because it couldn’t access your home directory.\nNow\nfeed the 3-headed dog\nby typing:\nkinit\nand then giving your password. You’ll get a new\nKerberos Ticket Granting Ticket\n.\nYou can then close the\nMATE Terminal\n. If you want to open another one, it should open this time without the error messages.\nIf Kerberos has so badly messed-up your Linux workstation that the GUI is\ncompletely frozen and you can’t do anything\n, then your best option is to\nssh\n-in remotely from another computer and\nkinit\non the command-line.\nQ #24: Help! I Double-Clicked On My “Home” Folder And Was Denied Access!\nIn Ubuntu’s MATE GUI, you might see something like this (substitute “hebron” [that’s me, the author of this documentation] with your username):\nand in CentOS 6’s GNOME GUI, you might see something like this:\nThe message in MATE about there being\nno application installed for symbolic link files\nis a\nred herring\n.\nDo not\nhit ‘yes’ to search for an application to open the file!\nThe real problem is that your\nKerberos Ticket\nhas expired and therefore the system cannot follow the symbolic link that points to your home directory.\nThe solution is to get a new\nKerberos Ticket\n.\nSee Q#23\nfor details.\nQ #25: Help! The Linux GUI Says That My Firefox Profile Is Missing!\nIn Ubuntu’s MATE GUI, you might see this:\nand in CentOS 6’s GNOME GUI, you might see this:\nThis most likely means that your\nKerberos Ticket\nhas expired, and therefore Firefox can no longer see your home directory.\nTo fix this, you need to get a new\nKerberos Ticket\n.\nSee Q#23\nfor details.",

You can restrict access to one or more named people, to the members of any SFU mailing list, or to anyone in the SFU community. In all cases, people trying to access the pages will be prompted for a username and password, and they would enter those they use for their SFU e-mail.\nAlternatively you can restrict access to a username / password combination that you invent (useful if you want a non-SFU person to access your pages.)\nAdjacent to your pages, you need to set up a file called\n.\nhtaccess\n. The AuthUserFile line in .htaccess, if needed, must read\nAuthUserFile /webdav/web/\nfoldername\n/.htpasswd\nSpecify the folder in which your web pages are installed, instead of\nfoldername\n.\nLIMITING ACCESS TO PAGES INSTALLED ON UNIX\nUsing any Unix editor, put a file called\n.htaccess\nin the directory that contains the web pages to be restricted. All sub-directories will be similarly restricted. If you have parallel directories to be restricted, put a\n.htaccess\nfile in each of them. Permit it appropriately:\nchmod 644 .htaccess\nSOME SIMPLE EXAMPLES\nAdd content like this to .htaccess:\nExample 1 .htaccess file to always prompt for an account and password\nAuthType CAS\nrequire valid-sfu-user\nTo provide upward computability with earlier ways of protecting access to web pages, you can replace the AuthType CAS withAuthType Basic.\nor this:\nExample 2 .htaccess file to allow machines in the sfu.ca domain to access your pages, otherwise prompt for an account and password\nAuthType CAS\nallow from sfu.ca\nrequire valid-sfu-user\nRead example 1's notes.\nThe only difference between examples 1 and 2 is the \"allow from .sfu.ca\" line.\nanother example:\nExample 3 .htaccess file always prompts for an account and password, but only allows access if the connection is from a machine in the sfu.ca domain\nAuthType CAS\nallow from sfu.ca\nrequire valid-sfu-user\nsatisfy all\nRead notes from examples 1 and 2.\nThe default for the satisfy line is satisfy any which is why example 2 allows access from an SFU machine or when someone supplies an id and password.

You can also direct them to the how-to page on\ndelegate login for sponsored account\nfor more details.\nI AM A DELEGATE FOR ONE OR MORE SPONSORED ACCOUNT(S), IS THERE A LIST THAT SHOWS ALL THE ACCOUNTS I HAVE DELEGATE ACCESS TO?\nTo view a list of delegated sponsored accounts you have access to, follow these steps:\nOpen any web-based CAS protected services (e.g.,\nSFU Mail via web browser\n)\nLog in using your own SFU account credentials with the format below:\nUsername:\n:yourcomputingID\nEnsure you have a colon in front and replace\nyourcomputingID\nwith your SFU Computing ID (e.g., :kipling).\nPassword:\nThe password for your SFU computing ID\nMFA:\nThe MFA code associated with your account\nTroubleshooting and Technical FAQ\nWHY AM I NOT SEEING MY SPONSORED ACCOUNT ON DAM?\nYou must be the sponsor of the sponsored account for your sponsored account to appear on DAM. If you are the current sponsor, and your account is not showing on DAM, the sponsored account information may be out of date. Contact the\nIT Service Desk\nor visit\nSFU SAM\nto update your sponsored account information.\nAlternatively, the sponsor can add you as a manager of the sponsored account which will allow you to see the sponsored account on DAM for you to manage delegate access.\nI SEE PERSONAL SPONSORED ACCOUNTS ON DAM, SHOULD I ENABLE DELEGATE ACCESS ON THOSE ACCOUNTS?\nIn most cases, you don't need to enable delegate access on those accounts. Enabling delegate access provides additional login methods to the sponsored account which is typically useful for sharing sponsored accounts.\nI AM NOT THE PRIMARY USER OF THE SPONSORED ACCOUNT, JUST A SPONSOR. DO I NEED TO ENABLE DELEGATE LOGIN?\nWe recommend talking to the primary user of the sponsored account. For cases where the sponsored account needs to be shared to others or transferred to other users at a relatively fast rate, you may need to enable delegate access and provide manager role on DAM to the primary user for them to manage account access.\nIn other cases where the sponsored account does not need to be shared or transferred, enabling delegate access may be unnecessary.\nDOES ENABLING DELEGATE ACCESS RESTRICT NORMAL LOGIN METHODS?\nNo, enabling delegate access means enabling an additional login method to the sponsored account on web-based CAS protected services. All existing logins and the normal method of logging into the sponsored account remain the same.\nWHAT SERVICES DOES DELEGATE LOGIN SUPPORT?\nDelegate login is only supported on web-based\nCAS\n-protected services that allow sponsored accounts to login. Services that don't allow sponsored accounts, such as FINS and myINFO, cannot use delegate login.\nI HAVE QUESTIONS OR FEEDBACK REGARDING DAM, WHO DO I CONTACT?\nIf you have need help or have any question or feedback regarding DAM, please contact the\nIT Service Desk\n.",

Technical documentation is only accessible to IT administrators.\nLog in to Confluence\nFrequently Asked Questions about Managed Windows Devices\nPRE-INSTALLATION FAQ\nHOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO ENROLL MY COMPUTER IN MEM?\nGenerally, when IT staff enrol your device, Windows will restart 2 (or in rare cases 3) times over about a 15 minute period. Installation of the Endpoint Manager client and services will continue in the background and you should be able to leave campus in less than 2 hours. This may take longer if large software packages are pending.\nWILL MY WORK BE IMPACTED?\nInstallation will require a couple of reboots on your computer when the client is first installing. After that the installation will continue to run in the background without niceable impact to the user.\nIF I HAVE A LAPTOP DO I NEED TO BRING IT ON CAMPUS?\nYes. At this time, it is required to bring it to campus to do the initial install Endpoint Manager. Once this is accomplished, it will function off-campus.\nHOW WOULD IT BE CLEANED FOR COVID-19 SAFETY MEASURE?\nWe can usually have Endpoint Manager install if you are in your office or otherwise on campus and can trigger the process and monitor it remotely.\nIn the case you do need to come in to our offices:\nYou are requested to wear a mask when visiting the IT Services office\nWe recommend IT support staff use one of the following methods to service your laptop:\nuse RDP (remote desktop) or TeamViewer\nuse an external keyboard and mouse\nuse gloves and wipe down the keyboard and trackpad with alcohol-based wipes when receiving and returning the device. this ensures safety from contaminated surfaces, and alcohol-based wipes are safe for the electronics\n(\ndo not use Windex or other water-based cleaners on your laptop!\n)\nPRIVACY CONCERNS - WHAT INFORMATION DOES ENDPOINT MANAGER COLLECT?\nThe IT Services implementation of Endpoint Manager has been customized to collect only the data needed to support computers running a Microsoft Windows operating system. This information includes:\nHardware Specifications\nInstalled Applications & Usage\nServices Running\nAvailable Software Updates\nLocal User Accounts and Login/Logout Timestamps\nSecurity Status (Firewall, encryption, etc)\nConnected Peripheral Devices\nNo personal information is collected, such as the contents or names of personal files (documents, email, etc) or any browsing history. All data is stored on-premises as of July 2020.\n(If you have roaming profiles for backup on your desktop or backup on your laptop, these files are stored on SFU's servers separately from Endpoint Manager)\nPOST-INSTALLATION FAQ\nIS MY COMPUTER ENROLLED IN ENDPOINT MANAGER?\nTo find out if your computer is enrolled, look for the Endpoint Manager object found in the Windows Control Panel. Additionally, you may look for “Software Center” in your Windows Start menu.\nWHAT IS SOFTWARE CENTER?\nThe Software Center application is similar to a mobile device app store (similar to Managed Software Center on University Macs), but it provides customized content for university Windows systems. This content includes access to University approved software, maintenance task scheduling, support options, and other documentation.\nCAN I CONNECT TO SOFTWARE CENTER WHEN I AM OFF-CAMPUS?\nBeginning\nOctober 26, 2020\n, MEM clients are able to take configuration and software updates from off-campus.\nDevices that have not been on campus since this date must connect to the campus network\none last time\nin order to pick up this new policy change. The SFU VPN service is adequate for performing this from off-campus. See your local IT support staff for more information.\nHOW DO I UPDATE SOFTWARE?\nUPDATING SOFTWARE\nThe Software Center gives you the flexibility of choosing\nwhich\napplications to update and\nwhen\nto update them.\nAdditonally, the Options tab allows clients to choose \"Business Hours\" when updates should\nnot run\nin order to minimize interruptions.\nThe software install deadline is clearly shown. After this date, clients are given a couple days to defer, but after this point all updates are\nforced\nto install.\nHOW CAN I CHOOSE WHEN UPDATES RUN?\nSetting updatea auto-install options\nOpen Software Center and click the \"Options\" tab on the left. Here you may specify \"Business Hours\" which is effectively the times that MEM may not install software and updates. Please choose a reasonable time frame.\nAll software deployments have a deadline of 14 days from notifiaction. Failing to allow Windows to apply updates within this two week period will result in a forced install that may interrupt your work day!\nTECHNICAL QUESTIONS\nHOW DOES ENDPOINT MANAGER WORK?\nThe Endpoint Manager infrastructure consists of several high-performance, redundant servers which provide a database of computer information and data storage for programs, applications, and operating system images for deployment to end-user computers. Endpoint Manager uses a small software utility known as an \"agent\" to communicate with the servers. This agent inventories hardware specifications, software installation information and provides for the automated installation of software updates and security patches. Included with the agent is another application called \"Software Center\", which will be described below.\nAll client/server communication is encrypted by a certificate pair configured when the agent is installed.\nWHAT CHANGES DOES THE INSTALLATION OF ENDPOINT MANAGER MAKE TO A PC?\nEndpoint Manager installs the agent to your PC. The agent runs in the background and will not interfere with the operation of your computer. Additionally, Endpoint Manager installs the Software Center application and the Endpoint Manager control panel object.\nWILL I STILL HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE ACCESS TO MY PC?\nDevice management doesn't preclude\nownership\nnor\nadministration\nof the PC.\nManaged Windows at SFU adopts best practices for security, patching and configuration options as specified by your IT unit.\nThere will be no automatic\nchanges\nto the privileges of your user account by enrolling in Endpoint Manager. Your local IT support will contact you if changes are to be made.\nWHAT POLICIES ARE ENFORCED?\nFirewall, security, and\nApplocker\npolicies are default on all managed Windows systems at SFU. Additional distribution of policies is the responsibility of individual local IT manager. If you have any questions about what policies are enforced, please contact your local IT support.\nIT Services does provide and maintain a large catalog of software, maintenance tasks, and other links in Software Center. The Software Center catalog may also be supplemented by your local IT support, with support for self-service items (for example, Adobe Acrobat Pro to users with SFU Adobe Enterprise IDs).\nFrequently Asked Questions about Managed Mac Devices\nWHAT IS A MANAGED MAC?\nThe Endpoint Manager infrastructure consists of several high-performance, redundant servers which provide a database of computer information and data storage for programs, applications, and operating system images for deployment to end-user computers. Endpoint Manager uses a small software utility known as an \"agent\" to communicate with the servers. This agent inventories hardware specifications, software installation information and provides for the automated installation of software updates and security patches. Included with the agent is another application called \"Software Center\", which will be described below.\nAll client/server communication is encrypted by a certificate pair configured when the agent is installed.\nWILL I LOSE CONTROL OF MY MAC?\nNot necessarily. The understanding is that we work on the computer (on your behalf) so that you can focus on your work. Management does not preclude ownership nor administration of the workstation. Some owners of managed Macs are administrators on their own computers. However, most software or configuration requests can be handled quite quickly and readily (usually faster than most users can obtain the software themselves).\nDOES THIS MEAN I WON'T BE ABLE TO INSTALL PROGRAMS?\nPursuant to the previous point, it is still possible for many classes of users to install their own versions of software, either from the App Store or via other means. Additionally, it is always possible to install applications in your home ~/Applications folder to meet your organizational goals. Don't see software that you need?\nAsk for it\n, we can usually assign new software titles in minutes.\nWHICH PROGRAMS DO YOU INSTALL?\nThe list is extensive, and ever changing. Suffice to say (with a few exceptions) that any managed Mac gains access to almost ALL the software the University has license for.\nDO YOU BACKUP ALL MY FILES?\nI.T. Services is slowly rolling out a backup service for all administrative staff managed Macs. Talk to your local support person for more information.\nI DON'T WANT TO BE MANAGED, CAN I STILL RECEIVE SUPPORT?\nThe managed Mac team at Simon Fraser University has an ongoing committment to ensuring a safe, reliable and productive computing environment on campus. To this end, we try and respond to all\nreasonable\nrequests for help. For more information, simply email\nmac-help@sfu.ca\nRelated Articles (1)\nUpgrade Your Device to Windows 11\nManaged devices upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11.",

Troubleshoot your VPN connection\nIf you're having difficulty connecting to SFU VPN, see\nTroubleshooting connection issues with SFU VPN\nfor common errors and resolutions before submitting a ticket.\n7. SFU VPN FAQs\n1. Can I use SFU VPN to bypass government or service restrictions?\nUnlike commercial solutions, SFU Virtual Private Network (VPN) does\nNOT\nby-pass travel restrictions or re-route traffic. For instance, SFU VPN won't help you access websites blocked by national firewalls.\n2. Can I use another VPN app to connect to SFU VPN?\nOnly FortiClient VPN is supported by IT Services. Other VPN apps may not comply with the university's security and privacy standards.\n3. WHICH services require VPN for access?\nmyINFO\n,\nFINS\n,\neTRACS\n, and Hyperion are a few of the resources that are only available while connected to the SFU on-campus network or on SFU VPN. Many online resources will be unaffected by this (such as Canvas, SFU Mail, Zoom, SFU Vault).\n4. CAN I LOG IN TO SFU VPN USING A SPONSORED / DEPARTMENTAL ACCOUNT?\nWe recommend logging in to SFU VPN using your\npersonal SFU account\n, and accessing any sponsored accounts once you are connected to the VPN.\nFor users who\nonly\nhave access to\nsponsored accounts\nfor\npersonal use\n(i.e., your sponsored account is only used by a specific individual, where the password and access to the account would never be shared with or transferred to others.), you can enroll in\nSFU's Multi-factor Authentication\nand contact the\nIT Service Desk\nfor access to the VPN.\n5. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SFU VPN AND REMOTE DESKTOP CONNECTIONS?\nSFU VPN is a way for your own devices to securely connect with the SFU campus network without needing an on-campus workstation (such as an office PC). This lets your device directly connect to shared folders and other resources while off-campus.\nWith a\nremote desktop connection\n(also known as RDP), you remotely control an on-campus workstation by sending mouse clicks, movements and other desktop commands over the internet. RDP is a great way to access your on-campus desktop but comes with the technical overhead of maintaining an on-campus workstation.\n6. I MANAGE CREDIT CARD INFORMATION AT SFU. DOES SFU VPN MEET PCI DATA SECURITY STANDARDS?\nNo, SFU VPN is not PCI compliant. If you manage credit card information at SFU and are using SFU VPN, please follow\nSFU's best practices\n. If you have questions or concerns, please email\npci@sfu.ca\n.\nIf you have a question about SFU VPN but don't see it here, please contact the Service Desk.\nSubmit a ticket\nOverview\nThis article provides the account, security, and system requirements, installers, and instructions to set up and connect to SFU VPN.\nAccount and Security Requirements\nSystem Requirements\nDownload and install FortiClient VPN\nConfigure the VPN Connection\nConnect to SFU VPN\nTroubleshoot your VPN connection\nSFU VPN FAQ's\nAccount and Security Requirements\nAccount and Security Requirements\nSystem Requirements\nSystem Requirements\nDownload and install FortiClient VPN\nDownload and install FortiClient VPN\nConfigure the VPN Connection\nConfigure the VPN Connection\nConnect to SFU VPN\nConnect to SFU VPN\nTroubleshoot your VPN connection\nTroubleshoot your VPN connection\nSFU VPN FAQ's\nSFU VPN FAQ's",

If you are a new employee (including TAs and RAs),\nenroll in MFA\nas soon as possible to maintain your access to SFU online services.\nAll new students are required to enroll in MFA by the third week of your first term.\nWe recommend you visit the\nstudent guide\nand enroll early to maintain your access to SFU online services.\nExisting students (pre-2022) will be required to enroll in MFA at a future date.\nWe recommend you visit the\nstudent guide\nand enroll early to maintain your access to SFU online services.\nAll sponsored accounts are required to enroll in MFA within three weeks after account activation\n. Accounts enrolled in\nDelegated Account Management\n(DAM) will be MFA-locked upon enrollment in DAM. We recommend enrolling early to maintain your access to SFU online services. Sponsored account users should visit the\nsponsored account MFA page\nfor details.\nI have a sponsored account. What do I need to do to enroll in MFA?\nWe are aware that sponsored accounts are currently used to meet a variety of business needs.\nTo help you determine next steps for your sponsored account, please refer to\nsponsored account MFA page\nfor detailed instructions on enrolling in MFA.\nI don’t have, or I am unable to use a mobile device for MFA. What can I use instead?\nIf you do not have a mobile device or do not wish to use one for MFA, using a hardware token would be an alternative. A\nhardware token\nis a small device that displays the 6-digit code for logging into MFA. Please visit the\nSet up MFA\npage for more information.\nNote:\nHardware tokens should\nnot\nbe used for backup purposes. There are dedicated\nemergency login codes\nthat serves as a backup if your mobile device is left at home, lost, or runs out of battery.\nWhich SFU applications are protected by MFA?\nCurrently, MFA at SFU is implemented for web applications that use\nSFU's Central Authentication Service (CAS)\nfor authentication. You will be prompted for your MFA code when you sign into most web applications and/or services at SFU, including:\nCAS-PROTECTED WEB APPLICATIONS\ngoSFU, Canvas\nFINS, myINFO\nSFU Mail (via a browser)\nZoom\nMicrosoft 365 (via web portal)\nSharePoint\nAEM (author.sfu.ca)\nSFU Maillist (maillist.sfu.ca)\nResearch Ethics Application system (Kuali)\nOTHER SERVICES (NON-BROWSER)\nSFU VPN\nRemote Desktop\nNote:\nFuture services at SFU will require you to be enrolled in MFA. More details will be announced with the new services.\nHOW WILL MFA CHANGE THE WAY I SIGN INTO SFU SYSTEMS?\nWith MFA, you will start by signing into SFU applications with your SFU Computing ID and password as you currently do. Next, you will be asked to type in the\n6-digit MFA code\n(changes every 30 seconds) that you see on your MFA device (e.g., mobile device/hardware token).\nThere is also the option of “remembering” your MFA sign-in for 7 days.\nNote:\nRemember to keep your MFA device nearby to sign in using the 6-digit MFA codes. You should only use your 8-digit emergency login codes as the last resort.\nCan I enroll both a hardware token and mobile device?\nNo. Currently, our system does not support multiple MFA devices.\nWill my MFA experience differ when I am travelling?\nYour MFA experience should not differ in any way when you are travelling. You will continue to be prompted every day, or every 7 days, depending on whether you have set MFA to remember you.\nUsing MFA FAQ\nWhat are the differences between MFA codes and Emergency Login Codes?\nThere are 2 types of codes you would encounter when using MFA:\nMFA code\nA\n6-digit code\nthat refreshes every 30 seconds on your mobile device or hardware token.\nMFA codes are used for\ndaily logins\n.\nEmergency Login Codes\nA set of\n8-digit codes\nthat are generated during your MFA setup and can be located in the\nSFU MFA Management App\n.\nEmergency logins codes are\nonly\nused\nwhen you\ndo not have access to your usual MFA codes\n(e.g., forgot/lost/broke your mobile device or hardware token).\nHow do I start using my MFA login? How do I retireve my MFA login codes?\nTo log in with MFA, you’ll enter your username and password as you currently do, and then type in the\n6-digit MFA code\n(changes every 30 seconds) that you see on your MFA device (e.g., mobile device/hardware token).\nThere is also the option of “remembering” your MFA sign-in for 7 days.\nNote:\nRemember to keep your MFA device nearby to sign in using the 6-digit MFA codes. You should only use your 8-digit emergency login codes as the last resort.\nHow often will I be prompted for MFA?\nBy default, you will be prompted for your MFA code every time you log into a CAS-protected SFU web application.\nIf you do not want to be prompted for MFA every time you log in, you may select the “\nRemember me on this browser for 7 days\n” checkbox just below the MFA code field.\nUpon successful sign-in, you will not be prompted for a MFA code for seven days on those browsers and devices/computers where you authenticated to “remember” your MFA sign-in.\nThis functionality allows each authenticated device/browser combination to maintain and \"remember\" your MFA authorization for 7 days.\nPlease note that you will be prompted for MFA if you perform any of the following actions:\nLog in using a different browser and device than the ones you previously authenticated to “remember” your MFA sign-in,\nClear your browsing history and/or cookies,\nEnable the browser to \"clear cookies and site data when you close all windows\",\nLog in under “incognito mode” or “private mode” on your browser, or\nLog in using the same device and browser after seven days since your last MFA sign-in.\nNote:\nTo view and/or remove the browsers you’ve allowed to “remember” your MFA login, please visit the\nSFU MFA Management App\n.\nWhat does the “Remember me on this browser for 7 days” checkbox do?\nIf you do not want to be prompted for MFA every time you log in to a web application, you may check this checkbox to have your browser remembered for 7 days. To view and/or remove the trusted browsers you authenticated to \"remember me for 7 days\", please visit\nSFU MFA Management App\n.\nPlease note that you will be prompted for MFA if you perform any of the following actions:\nLog in using a different browser and device than the ones you previously authenticated to “remember” your MFA sign-in,\nClear your browsing history and/or cookies,\nEnable the browser to \"clear cookies and site data when you close all windows\",\nLog in under “incognito mode” or “private mode” on your browser, or\nLog in using the same device and browser after seven days since your last MFA sign-in.\nWhy was \"7 days\" chosen as the time period for the browser to remember me?\n\"\n7 days\n\" was chosen as the time period to remember a browser authentication because it's an option that balances between security and convenience.\nThe most secure option would be to authenticate every login, which is the default settings if the \"Remember me on this browser for 7 days\" checkbox is not selected. The more convenient option would be to authenticate every 30 days, where some institutions have chosen this option. However, this option would bring convenience at the cost of security.\nThis time period is also frequent enough so that it could be easily incorporated into a regular routine (e.g., Tuesday is my MFA day).\nWhy does my 6-digit MFA code change every 30 seconds?\nTOTP (Time-Based One-time Passcode) protocol for multi-factor authentication requires a time-based (30 second) code that the user must enter. It changes every 30 seconds to maximize security.\nHow do I securely store my emergency login codes?\nKeep your emergency login codes safe by following these important tips:\nStore your emergency login codes in a\nsafe, accessible place\nnearby you, such as your wallet.\nDo not store your emergency login codes on\nCAS-protected services\nsuch as your SFU Mail account, as you won't be able to access them if you don't have your phone or hardware token.\nNever share\nyour emergency login codes with anyone.\nYou can generate new emergency login codes at any time by going to the\nSFU MFA Management App\n.\nWhat if my mobile device/hardware token is left at home, is lost, or runs out of battery?\nIn the case where you don't have your phone or hardware token with you, you can use one of your emergency login codes for access to your SFU account.\nWhere to locate your emergency login codes:\nWhen you first set up multi-factor authentication, you will be given a list of\none-time emergency login codes\n. Ensure to\nprint/write them down\nand\nstore them in a safe, accessible place\n, such as your wallet.\nIf you have already gone through the MFA setup process\nand missed the opportunity to print/write down the list of emergency login codes for safekeeping, be sure to\nsign into the\nSFU MFA Management App\nto retrieve or generate new emergency login codes\nbefore\nyou come across a scenario of not having your mobile device/hardware token with you.\nMOBILE DEVICE FAQ\nDo I need to have cellular service or data coverage to use the MFA Applications?\nNo. Aside from the initial app download, TOTP MFA applications do not require any internet connection, cell service, or data coverage to display the MFA codes.\nNote:\nTOTP (Time-based One-time Password) protocol for multi-factor authentication requires a time-based (30 second) code that the user must enter. It changes every 30 seconds to maximize security.\nWill my personal information be collected through MFA and/or the MFA app?\nNo. SFU’s MFA service is built and hosted at SFU and does not collect personal information. In addition, the recommended mobile app, LastPass Authenticator, does not collect personal information.\nHow it works\n: When you scan the QR code with your mobile app as part of the initial MFA setup, the app is obtaining a secret key from SFU’s MFA servers from which your MFA login codes will be generated.\nFrom that point onward, there is no MFA-related communication made from your mobile app. Your mobile app only relies on your mobile device’s time and the secret key for the MFA login code generation every 30 seconds.\nThis is also why the app does not require cellular service nor an internet connection to function.\nNote:\nSFU recommends LastPass Authenticator because of the benefits it provides to users, but we are\nnot affiliated\nwith LastPass Authenticator or any third-party MFA applications. You are free to choose any of the MFA mobile apps that support the TOTP protocol.\nWhy is LastPass Authenticator recommended?\nWe recommend LastPass Authenticator because:\nIt's free to use,\nIt does not collect personal information (only requests file permissions for storing your MFA locally, and camera permissions for scanning QR code),\nIt does not require an internet connection to function (aside from the initial app download), and\nIt's reputable and well-known MFA mobile app.\nNote:\nSFU recommends LastPass Authenticator because of the user benefits described above, but we are\nnot affiliated\nwith LastPass Authenticator or any third-party MFA applications. You are free to choose any of the MFA mobile apps that support the TOTP protocol.\nI already have an app that does MFA, can I use that?\nApplications that support the TOTP protocol will work for MFA at SFU. If you already have a MFA application that you are using for other services, you may continue to use that application for MFA at SFU as well.\nNote:\nSFU recommends LastPass Authenticator because of the benefits it provides to users, but we are\nnot affiliated\nwith LastPass Authenticator or any third-party MFA applications. You are free to choose any of the MFA mobile apps that support the TOTP protocol.\n*\nTOTP (Time-based One-time Password) protocol for multi-factor authentication requires a time-based (30 second) code that the user must enter. It changes every 30 seconds to maximize security.\nCan use a tablet or other mobile device that is not a smartphone for MFA?\nAny \"smart device\", such as iPad or Android tablet, can be used to run an MFA application.\nNote:\nMFA applications do not require any cell service or data coverage to work, but you will need internet access when you first download the application onto your device.\nI've recently acquired a new mobile device. What do I need to do?\nTo change the mobile device you use for MFA, please follow the instructions outlined on the\nChange MFA device\npage.\nHARDWARE TOKEN FAQ\nhow do I obtain a hardware token?\nPlease select one of the two options below:\nFor students, alumni, retirees and sponsored accounts\nwho are unable to or cannot use a mobile device for MFA, hardware tokens are available for purchase at the SFU Bookstore either in-store or\nonline\n.\nFor staff and faculty accounts\n, please visit\nRequest a Hardware Token\n.\nCan hardware tokens be mailed outside of Canada?\nYes, hardware tokens are sent via Canada Post Lettermail™.\nCan I have someone else to pickup the hardware token on my behalf?\nIf you are purchasing a hardware token from the\nSFU Bookstore\n, yes. Hardware tokens are tied to a specific user upon purchase.\nIf you are a staff or faculty requesting a hardware token, please contact\nIT Service Desk\nif token pickups are available when submitting a request.\nCan I get a new hardware token if I lose mine?\nTo replace a lost hardware token, see the two options below:\nFor students, alumni, retirees and sponsored accounts\n, a new hardware tokens will need to be purchase at the SFU Bookstore either in-store or\nonline\n.\nFor staff and faculty accounts\n, please visit\nRequest a Hardware Token\n.\nNote:\nIf you have lost your hardware token, use your\nMFA emergency codes\nto log into your account while obtaining a replacement hardware token or\nswitch to mobile\n.\nCan I use my personal hardware token (OTP token device) instead of requesting one?\nNo, since the hardware tokens are pre-programmed to your SFU account before giving it to you, using your own or personal hardware tokens will not be compatible with our systems.\nHow long will the battery last on my token?\nThe battery life of hardware tokens are expected to last at least around 4 to 5 years.\nTROUBLESHOOTING FAQ\nWhy is my browser not remembering my MFA login for 7 days?\nBy checking off the \"Remember me on this browser for 7 days\" checkbox at the login page, you can set your browser on a specific device to remember your MFA login for 7 days.\nThe following are some common reasons as to why a browser may fail to remember your MFA login for 7 days:\nClear your browsing history and/or cookies,\nEnable the browser to \"clear cookies and site data when you close all windows\",\nLog in under “incognito mode” or “private mode” on your browser,\nLog in using a different browser and device than the ones you previously authenticated to “remember” your MFA sign-in, or\nLog in using the same device and browser after seven days since your last MFA sign-in.\nTo view and/or remove the trusted browsers you authenticated to \"remember me for 7 days\", please visit\nSFU MFA Management App\n.\nIf your browser still doesn't remember your MFA login for 7 days, your browser may have outdated MFA cookies. Follow these steps to remove existing MFA cookies:\nVisit the\nSFU MFA Management App\nand select \"Trusted Browsers\" tab,\nRemove all your trusted browsers by clicking on the Trash Bin,\nClear your browsing history and/or cookies.\nRelated Articles (1)\nMulti-Factor Authentication - Students\nThis article is designed to provide students with a high-level summary of the MFA enrollment.\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA)\nSFU’s Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) refers to using two or more independent items to verify your identity, typically something you know (i.e., your SFU computing ID and password) and something you have (i.e., a time-based code).",

    "clean_body_text": "Information Security\nIdentity and Access Management\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA)\nOVERVIEW\nThis article is designed to provide you with a guide to enrol a sponsored account into MFA. For more information about the service, please visit the\nfull website for MFA\nor see our collection of\nFAQs\n.\nSPONSORED ACCOUNT REQUIRED TO ENROLL IN MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION\nAll sponsored accounts are required to enroll in MFA by March 31, 2022\n. We recommend enrolling early to maintain your access to SFU online services. The method in which your sponsored account is enrolled in MFA depends on how the account is used. Please choose from one of the two options below.\n1. I am the only person using this account\nThis sponsored account is\nused by one individual\n(or\npersonal sponsored account\n), where the password and access to the account would\nnever\nbe shared with or transferred to others.\nSome examples include sponsored accounts assigned to temporary staff or contractors. Usually, the name and Computing ID of personal sponsored accounts are created based on the first name and last name of the individual (for example, “Rudyard Kipling”,\nkipling@sfu.ca\n).\nIf you are the only person using the account, you may enroll it in MFA now. See \"How to Enroll into MFA\" for details.\nHow to enroll into MFA?\nPersonal sponsored accounts\ncan be self-enrolled in MFA just like a faculty/staff account. Visit\nSet Up MFA\nto get started.\n2. Multiple people use this account\nThis sponsored account is\nshared between multiple users\n(or\nrole/departmental sponsored account\n), where it is possible that the password or access to the account is shared with other individuals.\nSome examples include departmental roles, clubs/associations, and test accounts. Usually, the name and/or Computing ID are created based on the role or title and not an individual (for example, “IT Services”,\nitsinfo@sfu.ca\n).\nIf this account is shared between multiple people, you need to transition to using\ndelegate logins\n. This allows multiple people to log into a sponsored account using their own SFU account credentials. See \"How to Enroll into MFA\" for details.\nHow to enroll into MFA?\nIf you are the\naccount sponsor\nof the sponsored account, you will need to complete the following steps:\nEnable delegate access on your sponsored account using the\nDelegate Account Management\n.\nAdd delegates or managers\nto the sponsored account.\nInform your users of the sponsored account to use\ndelegate login\nto access the sponsored account.\nIT Services will enroll your sponsored account in MFA on your behalf. The sponsored account's MFA codes aren't required when using delegate login.\nIf you are\na current user\nof the sponsored account, you will need to take the following steps:\nInform the account sponsor to take the actions listed above.\nProvide your computing ID to the account sponsor to add you as a delegate to the sponsored account. You will receive an email once you're added.\nLog into the sponsored account using\ndelegate login\nwith your SFU account when you wish to access the sponsored account for your day-to-day tasks.\nNote\n: If you don't know the account sponsor of your sponsored account, see the sponsored account FAQ below.\nEnrolling Unique cases of Role/Departmental Sponsored Account\nWe are aware that sponsored accounts are used to meet a variety of business needs. Here are some examples of unique cases of using role/departmental sponsored accounts and how to implement MFA to your workflows:\nWhat should I do if my sponsored account is used by non-SFU user (i.e., vendors, contractors, or non-SFU volunteers)?\nIf the account is\ngiven to a single user outside of SFU\n:\nThe account can be treated as a personal sponsored account and can be self-enrolled in MFA. The primary user should visit\nSet Up MFA\nto get started.\nIf the account is\nshared to multiple users outside of SFU\n, every non-SFU user accessing SFU services should have their own sponsored account. The account sponsor will need to take the following steps:\nRequest additional sponsored accounts for every non-SFU user. Visit\nSponsored Computing ID\nfor details on requesting sponsored accounts.\nAfter every non-SFU user has their own sponsored account, inform the users that they can self-enrolled their sponsored accounts in MFA. The primary user should visit\nSet Up MFA\nto get started on their sponsored accounts.\n(Optional) If the shared sponsored account is used for centralizing data or file ownership, the sponsor may enable delegate access on this account using the\nDelegate Account Management\nand add the non-SFU users as delegates with their new sponsored accounts.\nIf the account is\nshared to multiple users mixed with both SFU users and non-SFU users\n, every non-SFU user accessing SFU services should have their own sponsored account. The account sponsor will need to take the following steps:\nRequest additional sponsored accounts for every non-SFU user. Visit\nSponsored Computing ID\nfor details on requesting sponsored accounts.\nAfter every non-SFU user has their own sponsored account, inform the users that they can self-enrolled their sponsored accounts in MFA. The primary user should visit\nSet Up MFA\nto get started on their sponsored accounts.\n(Optional) If the shared sponsored account is used for centralizing data or file ownership, the sponsor may enable delegate access on this account using the\nDelegate Account Management\nand add the non-SFU users as delegates with their new sponsored accounts.\nWhat should I do if my sponsored account is used by short-term users (i.e., visitors, guests, or short-term faculty)?\nAs part of SFU’s ongoing effort to improve the security of all online services, you may need to change your business workflows. Please take a look below if any of the following apply:\nIf your sponsored account is\nused to provide Wi-Fi access:\nSFU's wireless network provides a guest Wi-Fi network that does not require an SFU account. We encourage you to phase out the use of a shared sponsored account to provide Wi-Fi services to your visitors or guests.\nAlternatively, those who are members of higher ed or research communities may be able to access the\neduroam\nWi-Fi network.\nIf your sponsored account is\nused to provide library resources:\nGuidelines and policies outlined by SFU Library services must be followed. Members of the general public may access most of the Library’s online resources using SFU Library computers labs and open access resources can be accessed off-campus. A small number of databases are further restricted to current SFU students, faculty and staff only. We encourage you to phase out the use of a shared sponsored account to provide unrestricted library services to your visitors or guests.\nFor more information, visit\nguest access\n,\nguest logins\nor\npublic computer policy\nat SFU Library.\nIf your sponsored account\nuses other SFU services (i.e., Zoom, Canvas, etc.)\n, you may need a continue using sponsored accounts:\nEvery non-SFU user accessing SFU services should have their own sponsored account. You may need to request additional sponsored accounts for every non-SFU user. Visit\nSponsored Computing ID\nfor details on requesting sponsored accounts.\nAdditionally, we recommend enrolling these sponsored accounts into MFA with a hardware token to facilitate a 'physical transfer' of MFA for onboarding/offboarding short-term users. Hardware tokens for sponsored accounts can be purchased at this\nSFU Bookstore product page\n.\nWhat should I do if my sponsored account is a service account where no one logs into the account?\nAs long as your service account does not require CAS authentication to your services, you don't need to take action. IT Services will enroll the sponsored account in MFA on your behalf if you choose not to enroll in MFA. Enrolling the service account into MFA does not impact existing logins and the usual login methods outside of CAS.\nYou can access the service account using\ndelegate login\non web-based\nCAS\n-protected services without needing the service account's MFA codes once IT Services enrolls on your behalf.\nWhat should I do if my sponsored account is a lightweight account?\nAll lightweight accounts will need to be enrolled into MFA in the near future.\nTransferring sponsored account ownership after enrolling in MFA\nRole/departmental sponsored accounts typically involve transferring ownership for business continuity. Here are some examples depending on how the sponsored account is enrolled or used:\nWhat should I do if my role/departmental sponsored account has delegated access?\nAs the account sponsor, I'll be transferring ownership of the account myself:\nLog into the\nDelegate Account Management\napp and\nremove delegates\nto offboard SFU individuals and\nadd delegates\nto onboard SFU individuals.\nAs the account sponsor, I'll be leaving it up to the primary users to transfer ownership themselves:\nLog into the\nDelegate Account Management\napp and\nadd a manager\n(such as the primary user) for them to self-manage the sponsored account access.\nNote\n: If you are onboarding non-SFU users, you will need to provide every non-SFU user with their own sponsored account. Visit\nSponsored Computing ID\nfor details on requesting sponsored accounts.\nWhat should I do if my role/departmental sponsored account is given to non-SFU users?\nIf the sponsored account is enrolled with a mobile device:\nWhen the user is offboarding, the account sponsor will need to\nreset\nthe account password, then\ncontact\nthe\nIT Service Desk\nto reset the MFA registration to expire previous mobile registrations.\nWhen a new user is onboarding on the account, ask the new user to immediately prepare to enroll into MFA at their first login.\nIf the sponsored account is enrolled with a hardware token:\nWhen the user is offboarding, the account sponsor will need to\nreset\nthe account password, then\nask\nthe user to return the hardware token (if the token is purchased by the sponsor or department). If the hardware token is not returned (or is purchased by the user), contact the\nIT Service Desk\nto reset the MFA registration to expire previous hardware token registrations.\nWhen a new user is onboarding on the account, the account sponsor should provide them with a hardware token or ask the new user to immediately prepare to enroll into MFA at their first login if the MFA registration was reset.\nNote\n: The process outlined here should only be used when transferring the use of a sponsored account to\nanother individual without an SFU Computing ID and who cannot use delegated login.\nEvery time the account is transferred, the\naccount sponsor must reset the account password and MFA registration to revoke any previous access\n. There can only be one user for each sponsored account at a time.\nSponsored Account FAQ\nDoes MFA affect Outlook Desktop, Thunderbird, or other email clients?\nEnabling delegate access or enrolling in MFA with the sponsored account does not impact existing logins and the usual login methods to email clients. At this time, email client connections use SFTP and not through SFU\nCAS\n.\nPlease note that this is\nexpected to change\nonce SFU Mail migrates to Exchange Online in the near future, allowing connections to SFU Mail using email client to go through SFU\nCAS\n. For details, visit our SFU\nMicrosoft 365 Road Map\n.\nI don't know the sponsor of my sponsored account. How do I find out?\nYou can use the\nSponsor Lookup App\nto find who is the sponsor of your sponsored account. Once you're logged in, enter the sponsored account computing ID you wish to lookup the sponsor.\nNote\n: To access the app, you must be logged into a staff, faculty or sponsored account, and be connected to\ncampus networks\n(or SFU VPN).\nHow do I obtain a hardware token for my sponsored account?\nFor sponsored accounts that are unable to or cannot use a mobile device for MFA, or prefer a hardware token to facilitate a 'physical transfer' of MFA for onboarding/offboarding processes, hardware tokens are available for purchase via the SFU Bookstore either in-store or\nonline\n.\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA)\nSFU’s Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) refers to using two or more independent items to verify your identity, typically something you know (i.e., your SFU computing ID and password) and something you have (i.e., a time-based code).",

Team members may have different constraints that may affect response times.\nTake note of your team member’s availability status. They may need to focus on other tasks and may not respond to your message immediately as a result.\nBe polite, professional and respectful\nin all your conversations.\nThe use of images, memes, emojis, stickers and GIFs can convey different tones. Use them mindfully.\nThe use of ALL CAPS can signal yelling or shouting. Use them appropriately.\nUse\n@mentions\nmindfully.\nIf you need a team member’s attention to read or reply, using mentions (@name) is appropriate.\nOnly use channel-wide mentions (@channels) or team-wide mentions (@team) if you are requesting attention from the entire team. This creates a notification for everyone in that channel/team.\nConsider using the emoji reaction button\nto acknowledge a message in place of short replies.\nMake use of the reply button\nwhen posting a reply to a conversation in a channel. Posting your reply as a new message (instead of using the reply button) can make the conversation more difficult to follow.\nKeep channel conversations relevant to that channel’s purpose and topic.\nFor ad hoc conversations, consider using the chat function instead of posting messages in channels.\nMeetings and Calls\nStrive to start and end calls/meetings on time.\nIf you are an attendee and anticipate that you will be late for a call/meeting, notify the meeting organizer ahead of time with a quick chat message.\nMute yourself when you are not speaking.\nThere may be background sounds that you may not be aware of, but others may hear.\nLeave a message in the meeting chat\nif you joined late or need to leave early, instead of interrupting the speaker by announcing it verbally.\nUtilize\nbackground effects\n(or blurred background)\nif there are visual distractions in your video background. Select an appropriate background effect based on your audience. If you are eating or doing tasks that can be visually distracting to others, consider turning off your camera.\nTeams and Channels\nFor Team Members\nBe mindful about who you are inviting into your team.\nNew team members will be able to see all previous messages and files on public channels. If you are not a Team Owner, it is best to inform your Team Owner before inviting people to a team.\nIt is best to\nspeak with the team owner(s) before creating a new channel\n.\nIf there are certain files or conversations that are should only be accessed by specific team members,\nconsider creating a private channel\n.\nOnly upload and share files that are relevant to your team or project.\nFor your own files that are unrelated to the team, you can store them in your own OneDrive account.\nFor Team Owners\nBefore requesting a new team\n, have a conversation with your local IT staff or whomever may be overseeing the collection of teams for your faculty/department/unit. This is help minimize the creation of duplicate teams with overlapping purposes and/or memberships. Also consider whether a new\nchannel\nwithin an existing team would be sufficient.\nCheck with your faculty/department/unit for guidelines on the naming conventions\nand appropriate imagery for your team picture (i.e., the image identifying your team).\nInform team members before renaming a channel\nto minimize confusion.\nBefore removing a member/guest from your team\n, notify them and ensure that the document storage and retention policies in your faculty/department/unit are addressed. MS Teams will not send a notification to the member/guest removed from your team.\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nMicrosoft Teams\nMicrosoft Teams (MS Teams) is a virtual collaboration app that brings together Microsoft 365 services (such as Office and OneDrive) to keep you virtually connected to the SFU community from anywhere at any time.",

There are\n2 types\nof teams:\nPublic team\nPrivate team\nAnyone from the organization can join\nimmediately without an approval from the team owner(s). Visible to\neveryone at SFU\nby searching in the Teams.\nOnly people who have been approved\nby the team owner(s) can join the team. Team owner(s) and team members can invite people to join.\nExample\n: MS Teams Community of Practice\nExample\n: departmental team, project team, closed special interest group, etc.\nNote:\nAll the teams requested via the\nRequest a Team webform\nare\nprivate\nteams, and they are\nhidden\nfrom the search in Teams. However, you can\nchange your privacy status\nafter the team has been created.\nChannels\nA team is made up of one or more channels. A\nchannel\nis a space for discussion or conversations\nwithin\na team, dedicated to a specific topic. It can be either\npublic or private\nto the members with that team.\nQuick example\nFor example, \"\nDepartment of Basket Weaving - SFU Teams\"\nis a\nprivate team\nthat has many different\nchannels\n(e.g., Communications, IT support, Onboarding).\nAll the conversations, meetings, files, and apps in the \"Communications\" channel has to do with the topic of communications within the Department of Basket Weaving. This channel is also visible to everyone within the team.\nWhat are the limits in MS Teams (e.g., members, channels, and storage, chat, etc.)?\nTeam\nNumber of members: 25,000\nNumber of owners: 100\nNumber of channels: 200 (includes deleted channels)\nNumber of private channels: 30 (includes deleted channels)\nNumber of members in a private channel: 250\nStorage capacity: 1 TB + 10 GB per user in team\nNumber of teams a user can be a member of: 1000\nNote.\nDeleted channels can be restored within 30 days. During these 30 days, a deleted channel continues to be counted towards the 200 channel or 30 private channel per team limit. After 30 days, a deleted channel and its content are permanently deleted and the channel no longer counts towards the per team limit.\nPrivate Chat\nNumber of people in a private chat: 250\nNumber of people in a video or audio call from chat: 20\nFile storage capacity in a private chat: depends on your remaining OneDrive storage space\nFor more information, please refer to Microsoft's page on\nLimits and Specifications for Microsoft Teams\n.\nHow are the teams at SFU structured\nHere are some suggestions on how you can structure your team(s) at SFU:\nNote:\nIf you need any assistance in determining the structure of your team, we recommend consulting your\ndepartment's IT support\npoints\nto align with internal processes/procedures (if any) on the team structure.\n1. Short-term collaboration space for project, research, or campaign\nCommon channels\n: Admin, Business Analysis, Project team, Technical, Communication, Planning, Reports, Documents, Safety, and Governance\nNote\n: You can consider creating a\ngroup chat\nif the purpose is to use it for a relatively short time (e.g., 2 - 4 weeks), or a channel within an existing team if all members are already a part of a same team.\n2. Long-term collaboration space for department, office, or function\nCommon channels\n:\nPublic: Functions/Projects, Document/Resources, Procedures/Forms/Templates, Announcement, Social/Fun/Chat/Random, Committees, Events, Meeting agendas/Meeting minutes, Reports, Admission, Marketing, IT, and Safety\nPrivate: Admin, Leadership, Projects, HR, Finance, Operations\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nMicrosoft Teams\nMicrosoft Teams (MS Teams) is a virtual collaboration app that brings together Microsoft 365 services (such as Office and OneDrive) to keep you virtually connected to the SFU community from anywhere at any time.",

    "clean_body_text": "A/V and Media\nZoom\nTeaching/Learning with Zoom in Canvas\nLive Proctoring with SFU Zoom\nSFU Zoom is an approved option for live remote proctoring of exams. Although SFU Zoom is not a remote proctoring software it can:\n• mimic physical observation that occurs during in-person exams\n• confirm which student is taking the exam\n• be a reminder of academic integrity guidelines at SFU.\nNote that when SFU Zoom or any other method is used for live proctoring the session must not be recorded.\nThe strongest recommendation for ensuring academic integrity is exams and exam questions that are tailored to require unique student reflection and work. There are also a number of features in Canvas that can be leveraged to discourage cheating or make it more difficult to cheat on exams. To learn more, please visit https://www.sfu.ca/cee/services/online-exam-options.html or reach out to the Centre for Educational Excellence for advice.\nThe following guidelines have been developed by CEE and ITS to ensure a reasonably seamless experience using SFU Zoom for live remote proctoring.\nIf you need technical support with SFU Zoom, call the IT Service Desk at 778 782 8888 or send an email to it-servicedesk@sfu.ca. Check www.sfu.ca/itservices for current hours of support.\nScheduling Your Proctoring Session\nGo to https://sfu.zoom.us/ and select option sign in SFU Zoom\nLocate the meetings option in the left navigation menu bar.\nEnter the meeting settings:\nSelect registration required\nMeeting password: assign a unique password or SFU Zoom will create a random numeric passcode\nVideo: host on, participant on\nDisable enable join before host\nEnable Mute Participants upon entry\nEnable Enable waiting room\nAssign alternative hosts. This will allow others to log-in and get your meeting started on your behalf. Please note, that the most effective way to add them is by entering their computingID@sfu.ca rather than their e-mail alias.\nIf you are limiting each proctoring session to a certain number of participants, have others set up additional meetings following the same process. Note that the current Online Exam Procedures (the document equivalent to in-person exam procedures) indicates that for final exams there should be one invigilator for up to 25 students and at least one additional invigilator per each additional 50 students. Additional proctors may also be made co-hosts of the session.\nProctoring for Students Registered with Centre for Accessible Learning\nIf your class includes students registered with the Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL), please refer to the instructions they have provided on Zoom proctoring.\nShare the Registration Link\nOnce the session is scheduled, the registration link and invitation are provided. Click Copy the Invitation and paste it into your preferred communication channel with students. We recommend that you do this either through e-mail or through the Canvas learning management system.\nStudents will register for the exam session and receive a unique link to access the session. They will need to click that link from a browser (or paste it into a browser) before selecting the option ‘Open zoom.us’ to launch the meeting.\nTechnology Requirements\nDetermine the necessary technology requirements for your session. It is possible to proctor with both one device or with two devices to get a secondary camera view of the student workspace. Please be aware of potential student limitations in access to a secondary device with a camera to participate in two device proctoring. A reliable internet connection will be necessary for all students. It is advisable to make a contingency plan for what you will do if there are internet connectivity issues for a student.\nOne Device Option:\nStudents will need a laptop or desktop with a webcam to access SFU Zoom and the preferred format for exam taking (e.g. Canvas). Joining with a smartphone in addition to your computer may be required if you do not have a webcam.\nTwo Device Option:\nA first laptop or desktop with a webcam available and a second laptop, a smartphone, or a tablet to access SFU Zoom for remote proctoring. If you are opting for the two device option, please be clear as to positioning requirements for the second device.\nPreparation for Proctoring Session\nConduct a practice session at least 24 hours prior to the exam period so that you can test out your proctoring solution and ensure everything is working properly. We recommend that you do this as early as possible. Your practice session will be self-serve and should replicate the conditions of the actual exam. CEE and ITS staff will not be able to coordinate this session for you. This session is a great time to remind students of exam expectations so that they are prepared when they begin the exam or could be used as a study session.\nProctors should join prior to all students.\nAssign any co-hosts during the session.\nStudents should be informed to join the session at least 30 minutes early to allow for troubleshooting and resolution of technical issues. We recommend that you have a contingency plan for how you will handle technical issues that may occur during the session.\nStarting the Session\nThe proctor will log-in and begin the session\nIn the top right hand corner, you can change the view to gallery view so that you will see a grid of all the students joining the call. Depending on the number of students, you may need to rotate through the views throughout the session to see all students.\nOnce the session is started, proctor will:\nGo to the chat and change it so participants can chat with the host only.\nAdmit students one-by-one from the waiting room to confirm their names and identities\nMute participants if necessary\n4. Please note that as you will be monitoring students’ videos, names, and potentially audio, you must not record due to privacy concerns with the collection of such data.\n5. Communicate exam expectations. Ideally these will be shared both in the course communications, and in the practice session but it is valuable to re-iterate these expectations prior to beginning the exam. Expectations will include but are not limited to:\na. How to ask questions to the proctor\nb. What to do when the exam is completed\nc. What is allowed or not allowed during the exam (e.g. using scratch paper, calculators, notes, etc.)\nDuring the Exam\nProctors can click on individual students’ video boxes to expand the view of that student.\nIf a problem arises, students will let the proctor know through the aforementioned method of asking questions, whether that be through the chat, through the hand raising feature, or simply by unmuting themselves and asking a question.\nThe proctor can then decide whether the student needs to be moved into a breakout room. If you anticipate that many students will need to use this, you can have TAs in the breakout room(s) ready to assist.\nSelect breakout rooms in the SFU Zoom task bar and select the manual creation of breakout rooms.\nIt is advisable that depending on capacity, you should only have one student in a breakout room at a time.\nEnding the Exam\nStudents can Chat with the proctor to inform them they are complete. Proctor can verify exam submission and dismiss student.\nAt the end of the exam window, proctor will remind students that the exam window is closing, and they can submit their exam through Canvas or other method outlined by proctor or Canvas will automatically submit the exam for them when the exam time has closed. Once the exam window has closed students can be dismissed at the same time.\nIf you require additional guidance surrounding SFU Zoom for live remote proctoring, please contact ceehelp@sfu.ca or visit www.sfu.ca/cee and use the ‘How can we help you’ button in the bottom right hand corner to get assistance from an member of the Centre for Educational Excellence. Please note that we only work business hours (8:30 AM – 4:00 PM) and allow 24 hours for a reply from our support portal. If you need technical support with SFU Zoom, call the IT Service Desk at 778 782 8888 or send an email to it-servicedesk@sfu.ca. Check www.sfu.ca/itservices for current hours of support.",

    "clean_body_text": "Administrative and Business\nBusiness Capability and Process Automation\nEnterprise Service Management\nFor Service Managers\nOverview\nThis article covers the following topics:\nService Taxonomy\nWhat is a service category?\nWhat is a service?\nWhat is a service owner?\nWhat is a service offering?\nWhat is a service offering owner?\nService Taxonomy\nThe IT Services service catalogue houses all services (active and retired) using an IT service catalogue framework adapted from the EDUCAUSE paper\nThe Higher Education IT Service Catalog: A Working Model for Comparison and Collaboration\n. This framework is a shared body of knowledge that leverages expertise, research and standards from the higher education IT sector to help institutions overcome common service catalogue challenges.\nWhat is a Service Category?\n\"A logical grouping of services that benefit from being managed together. These high-level groupings should be meaningful to the IT service provider to facilitate budgeting and governance of services. Some institutions might choose to make these groupings visible to end users, whereas some might not and might even have different groupings (see the discussion of \"views\" earlier in this document). These categories should reflect the strategic goals of the institution and align with the overall governance model. Governance of IT services, including deciding on major projects, developing strategy, and managing funding, is generally conducted by groups aligned with the service categories. Most service catalogs will consist of six to ten service categories. Examples of service categories might include communication and collaboration, infrastructure, and teaching and learning.\" -\nThe Higher Education IT Service Catalogue Model (ECAR)\nService categories accomplish multiple goals. Firstly, they help IT Services (ITS) represent the work being done. For example, ITS may have 10 services dedicated to infrastructure or 20 services dedicated to learning technologies.\nSecondly, they act as a logical grouping for services so they can be discovered through exploration. However, it's important to keep in mind that the vast majority of services are found through direct searching. To avoid category confusion and paralysis, ITS takes a best-fit approach for services that can span multiple categories.\nWhat is a Service?\n\"\nAn end-to-end IT service that delivers value to customers, typically not identified by specific product or application names. The service combines people, processes, and technology to provide outputs or results that enable business capabilities or an end user's work activities and desired outcomes.\n\" -\nThe Higher Education IT Service Catalogue Model (ECAR)\nIn summary, a service is the\nmanagement of people, process and technology to deliver something valuable\nto another group so they don’t have to take on the associated costs or risks.\nFor example, IT Services may manage a student application system by offering a service that takes care of the maintenance, updates, and security on behalf of Student Services. This provides something valuable without that group needing to take on additional resources.\nWhat is a Service Owner (SO)?\n\"A service owner is accountable for the delivery of an IT service and the service offerings within. The purpose of this leadership role is to ensure that the service receives strategic attention and appropriate resources to support the mission and needs of the institution. The SO is responsible for the service as a whole through its entire life cycle and is accountable to the person in charge of overall IT service delivery. The SO’s accountability for a service is independent of where the underpinning technology components, processes, or professional capabilities needed to deliver the service and its offerings reside.\"\n-\nIT Service Ownership in Higher Education\nAs service owner also ensures the content for their service is up to date in the ITS service catalogue. In summary, a service owner is:\nA leadership role accountable for the delivery of an IT service and service offerings within.\nThis accountability is independent of where the underpinning technology components, processes, or professional capabilities needed to deliver the service and offerings reside.\nThis role ensures that the service receives strategic attention and appropriate resources to support its mission and needs within the institution.\nThis role is also responsible for the service through its entire life cycle.\nWhat is a Service Offering?\n\"The specific technology-focused activity or product used to deliver a service. These can be software bundles, custom application solutions, or other technology that enables a service offering. Multiple service offerings might exist for a single service.\" -\nThe Higher Education IT Service Catalogue Model (ECAR)\nFor example, a service managing campus printers may offer a way to:\nRequest repairs\nAssign a new printing key FOB\nDeploy a new printer to an office\nWhat is a Service Offering Manager (SOM)?\n\"A service offering manager is a boots-on-the-ground role that is responsible for the delivery of an IT service offering. The purpose of this role is to ensure comprehensive, efficient, and transparent management of and communication about the IT service offering in accordance with the service strategy. This role is accountable to the SO for the design, implementation, and ongoing maintenance and support of the offering. As with the service owner, the SOM’s responsibility for a specific service offering is independent of where the underpinning technology components, processes, or professional capabilities reside.\" -\nIT Service Ownership in Higher Education\nThe service offering manager is also responsible for updating any service offerings in the ITS service catalogue. In summary, this role is:\nA tactical role responsible for the delivery of an IT service offering.\nAccountable to the service owner for the design, implementation, ongoing maintenance, and support of the offering.\nEnsures comprehensive, efficient, and transparent management and communication about the IT service offering in accordance with a service strategy.\nThis role can be independent of where the underpinning technology components, processes, or professional capabilities reside.",

SurveyMonkey employees and subcontractors (the “Customer Support Staff”) will not access the Survey Data from outside Canada, except (a) when authorized by the Customer for the purpose of implementing, maintaining, repairing, troubleshooting or upgrading the customer’s account or the Services (the “Customer Support Services”), or (b) for data recovery purposes in the event of a system failure. Customer Support Staff will only ask for authorization to access the Survey Data as a last resort, after exploring every reasonable alternative. After receiving such authorization, Customer Support Staff will only access as much Survey Data as required to perform the Customer Support Services and will limit the period of access to the minimum time necessary. If the Customer does not authorize access to the Survey Data when reasonably requested to do so, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that as a consequence of the constraints imposed above, the Customer Support Services available to it in connection with the Services may be reduced or delayed and that any commitments, representations or warranties made by SurveyMonkey regarding Customer Support Services do not apply to accounts that have not enabled such access.\nGuidelines on the provision of data by you as a survey owner or participant\nYou should not disclose personal or private information about yourself that you do not wish others to see.\nAny personal information that you intend to publish (i.e. disclose) about a third party must be with the written consent of the third party prior to publishing it.\nPlease contact the\nOffice of Research Ethics\nif you have any questions about research involving humans or human data (e.g., consent processes, data management plans, maintaining participant confidentiality).\nPlease contact the\nInformation and Privacy Officer in the Archives and Records Management Department\nfor privacy related concerns.\nYou may not make the disclosure of personal information to SurveyMonkey a requirement for participation in University-related activities except as permitted by the BC Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.\nAccess\nSurveyMonkey Service is available to Simon Fraser University faculty, staff and students with an active SFU Computing ID.\nSupport\nAll support for the SurveyMonkey Service, including all end-user and survey support, is provided by SurveyMonkey.

For you to use remote management, your user profile will need to be added as an allowed account for your on-campus Mac.\nStep 1:\nAsk your departmental IT staff to configure your on-campus Mac\nOnly IT administrators can complete the following steps.\nOpen \"System Preferences\"\nSelecting \"Sharing\"\nSelect \"Remote Management\"\nUnder \"Allow access for\" select the + icon.\nSelect the user account to add.\n* Also consider disabling sleep mode for a reliable connection.\nStep 2: Set up MFA and SFU VPN\nYou won't be able to use remote desktop without MFA or SFU VPN.\nAlready have MFA and SFU VPN? Skip and proceed to Step 3.\nSetup instructions:\nSet up MFA\nSet up SFU VPN\nStep 3:\nSign in to SFU VPN\nSign in to SFU VPN app with your SFU computing ID and MFA code.\nStep 4:\nConnect to your on-campus Mac\nWhile signed in to SFU VPN, open Apple's built-in\nScreen Sharing app\nand enter the hostname of your on-campus Mac. See \"How to Configure Remote Access for Managed Macs\" for detailed instructions.\nHow to Configure Remote Access for Managed Macs\nThese instructions are for connecting a\nremote Mac to a managed Mac\non campus.\nApple provides a fairly simple resource for remote control like Microsoft does with Windows \"Remote Desktop\". It is not as feature-rich or mature as Microsoft Remote Desktop but it gets the job done.\nNote\n: Macs can use simple VNC, but\nwe will never use this\n. We will allow the\nScreen Sharing\nservice. When we do, we should take extra measures to tunnel through SSH to ensure it is encrypted.\nOne thing to look out for: The majority (over 85%) of managed Macs at the University are already configured for\nRemote Management\n.\nBoth services cannot be configured simultaneously\n, so the route you take will depend on how your Mac is currently configured.\nWith Apple screen sharing the user ID and password are sent encrypted, as are keystrokes and mouse movements.\nScenario 1: No Screen Sharing or Remote Management configured\nOpen System Preferences > Sharing\nClick on Screen Sharing\nBe sure to only allow access for your\nmain\nuser\nStop here.\nDo not ever enable VNC\nNote\n: We are NOT configuring VNC access at SFU, and doing so reduces security of our systems.\nNever, ever promote this practice.\nScenario 2: SFU managed Mac that has Remote Management configured\nIt is still possible for an administrator to allow your Mac's main user to access, but the process is a little different.\nOnly one service can be configured, so you must add your user in the \"Remote Management\" dialog.\nOpen System Preferences: Sharing\nDon't touch the Screen Sharing option.\nAs an administrator, highlight the \"Remote Management\" section.\nOn the right-hand dialog, only the first two options are necessary (observe and control)\nEnabling the remaining options will allow features only possible via\nApple Remote Desktop\n. This is not necessary.\nIf you are not the administrator of your Mac, please contact your local IT support personnel to make these changes for you. Connect to your Mac using the built-in Screen Sharing application.\nYou can find this app in:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Screen Sharing.app\nPower considerations:\nRemote wake services designed for Windows PCs are not reliable on routed networks for Macs. As such, if you need\nreliable\nremote access to your Mac, please consider\ntemporarily\ndisabling system sleep.\nFirewall considerations:\nThe service connects on TCP port 5900 (just like VNC). The user ID and password are sent encrypted, as are keystrokes/mouse moves.\nThe managed Mac firewall is set to allow connections at a rate of 6 failures per 30 seconds. Brute force attempts past this rate will be blocked.\nTunneling through SSH:\nAnother secure approach is to use an ssh tunnel for screen sharing. Do-able, but requires a bit of set up to work.\nUsing SSH port forwarding and VNC you can connect to your remote desktop using the Screen Sharing application.\nFirst connect to your machine over SSH and port forward 5900:\n$ ssh sfuid@mac.its.sfu.ca -L 5900:localhost:5900\nNow open \"Screen Sharing.app\" and connect to \"localhost\", specifically (you've already made a SSH connection to your Mac in this last step)\nThis way all portions of your connection are encrypted.\nFor additional information, see\nMac screen sharing by Apple\n.\nFrequently Asked Questions about Mac Remote Desktop\nMy on-campus Mac isn't responding. What should I do?\nIf inactive, on-campus devices will enter a sleep mode to conserve energy. For a reliable connection to your on-campus Mac, you will need to ensure that sleep mode is disabled. To help with energy conservation, SFU recommends that you only do this as a temporary measure.\nSFU doesn't centrally manage my on-campus Mac. Will I still need to use SFU VPN to connect?\nYes. Remote connection protocols (VNC, RDP and ARD) are all blocked while off campus to protect the SFU community from common threats.\nSFU VPN\nprovides an encrypted and secure connection to the SFU campus network and is required for remote connections to on-campus devices.",

    "clean_body_text": "Software and Application Distribution\nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft Teams\nGeneral Users\nOVERVIEW\nThis article references guidance published by\nSFU's Archives and Records Management\ndepartment. To view the original publication, visit:\nhttps://www.sfu.ca/archives/records-management/links-resources1.html\nThis article includes:\nRoles and Responsibilities\nM365 and the Records Management Lifecycle\nMS Teams Site Management\nUsing and Maintaining\nFinal Disposition\nAccess and Privacy\nIntroduction\nMS Teams is a communication and collaboration tool that has been provided to SFU employees as part of SFUs Microsoft 365 (M365) installation. Features of MS Teams include team chat or channels, one-on-one chat, document collaboration, video meetings, and integration with other Microsoft applications. When used as directed by this guideline, MS Teams can reduce reliance on email, facilitate document sharing, enable remote access, and support document synchronization.\nThis guide provides SFU employees with resources to help share, organize, manage, retain, and dispose of the information they create using MS Teams in accordance with records management best practice.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nAs a public body, SFU has a responsibility to create and keep records that document its decision-making and business activities. MS Teams is a communication and collaboration tool; it does not have the necessary functionality and controls to be considered a record keeping system. Therefore, when working in MS Teams:\nemployees are responsible for ensuring that the critical information they create or receive is filed in their departments record keeping system; and\ndepartments are responsible for maintaining a reliable record-keeping system, such as a Shared Network Drive, SharePoint on Premise Site, OnBase, etc.\nM365 and the Records Management Lifecycle\nThe\nrecords management lifecycle\nis a framework that describes the distinct phases of a record's existence, from creation to final disposition. At SFU there are several different tools that individuals and departments can use to create, use, maintain and retain records.\nOneDrive\nallows account holders to securely store, share and synchronise their individual files and folders from any device. OneDrive can be used during the\ncreation\nand\nuse\nphase of the records management lifecycle. For more information about OneDrive see OneDrive Best Practices for SFU Employees.\nMS Teams\nis a communication and collaboration tool. MS Teams can be used during the creation and use phase of the records management lifecycle.\nOnce records reach the\nmaintenance\nand\nretention\nphase of their lifecycle they can be transferred into a shared records repository (Shared Network Drives, ERMS, etc.) or continued to be managed in place in Teams. More guidance about records repositories is in development. Please visit the\nRecords Management Links and Resources\npage for more information.\nAs ITS continues to introduce new Microsoft 365 services, additional tools for managing electronic records, will be made available. For more information see\nMicrosoft 365 at SFU Roadmap\n.\nMS Teams Site Management\nEach MS Teams site passes through the following four phases: planning; documenting and implementing; using and maintaining; and final disposition. Listed below are record-keeping best practices MS Teams site owners and users should keep in mind during each phase.\nPlanning\nMS Teams sites should be established with the final disposition of both the site and the content on the site in mind. Since MS Teams sites are not intended for long-term storage of official university records, site administrators should have a plan in place for transferring records when they enter the maintenance and retention phase of the records management lifecycle.\nBefore creating an MS Teams site, consider the following:\nWhat is the purpose of the site?\nHow will Channels be structured?\nWho should have access to the site?\nHow long will the site be used?\nWho will be responsible for managing records created and shared on the site?\nWhen will records be transferred from the site to the department’s records repository?\nWho will decide when the site is inactive and ready to be deleted?\nDocumenting and Implementing\nCreate a management plan for your MS Teams site and ensure it is shared with all site members. A management plan should include the following information:\nPurpose of the site\nMembership of the site\nChannel names and description\nPermissions structure for the site and channels\nFolder structure\nNaming convention (consult the\nStandard Naming Convention for Electronic Records for more information\n)\nRecords retention requirements\nPlan for transferring records from the site to the department’s records repository\nPlan for how to identify when the site is inactive\nPlan for deleting the site\nUsing and Maintaining\nUploading Documents\nDocuments can be uploaded to a MS Teams site, to a specific Channel, shared in Channel posts, and shared in one-to-one chat. This can create file duplication and make finding information difficult. By establishing a folder structure and maintaining a consistent filing system, departments can reduce duplication and facilitate access to the records they create and store in MS Teams.\nTips\nKeep your folder structure simple.\nAvoid nested folder structures of more than two levels.\nKeep in mind the purpose of your site - do not set up directories which are out of scope.\nUpload documents to the appropriate folder and then share links. This will help avoid duplicating documents.\nKeep in mind that files uploaded within Channels are stored in an associated SharePoint library. However, files shared within one-to-one chat messages are stored in OneDrive.\nAdopt a file naming convention.\nVersion Control\nMS Teams has built in version control. Every time you save a file a new version is created. You can view, compare and restore previous versions of a document.\nThings to keep in mind:\nIf you download a document, change the title and then re-upload it, a separate document will be saved.\nIf you download a document, make changes and then re-upload it, a new version will be created.\nIf you edit a document online, a new version will be created.\nIf there are multiple editors making changes to the same document off-line, it may be necessary to merge versions to ensure all changes are captured. Departments may want to consider internal procedures for how they collaborate on documents to avoid confusion.\nAt the moment, ITS and Microsoft have not limited the number of versions saved for a single document. This may change in the future. Departments may want to consider internal procedures for saving important drafts outside of MS Teams.\nChannels\nMS Teams are made up of Channels, which are the “spaces” where group conversations and document collaboration take place. Channels can help Teams users classify and organize content created and/or uploaded in Teams. Each channel should be dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project and structured to encourage targeted content development. For example, establish a channel for a specific project or an event (for example, Department Website Redesign, or Fall Convocation 2023 Planning).\nChat\nMS Teams also includes a 1:1 chat feature, which allows users to chat directly with another person.\nReminder\nFiles uploaded using chat are stored in OneDrive.\nLimit the amount of personal information shared using chat as chat conversations are subject to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.\nDocumenting Decision Making\nThe chat and channels features should not be used for formal decision-making (e.g., contract negotiation, policy approval, etc.). These tools were created with document collaboration and communication in mind and not for documenting official direction or approvals.\nRetention policies for MS Teams are under development.\nOnce finalized, new policies may impact the length of time chats are retained. As such, users should not count on chats to be permanently available. Therefore, formal decision-making should be documented in meeting minutes, email correspondence, memos, briefing notes, etc., and stored in a centrally accessible location (e.g., meeting minutes stored on a department’s Shared Network Drive).\nIf, however, a formal decision is made using chat or channels users should ensure that the decision is captured (e.g., screen shot, follow-up email, etc.) and that all of the correct members of a team are informed of the decision and have access to the necessary records.\nRecording Meetings\nLike Zoom, MS Teams includes an option for recording meetings. There are many privacy considerations that should be addressed prior to recording a meeting. Staff meetings, academic advising sessions, job interviews etc., have not typically been recorded at SFU. The Archives strongly recommends against recording meetings for the purposes of administrative convenance or as a means of compiling meeting minutes and notes. For more information about recording meetings see\nZoom Privacy and Security\n. Although developed for Zoom, these guidelines can be applied to MS Teams.\nFinal Disposition\nAs mentioned previously, MS Teams is not considered a long-term storage repository for official university records. While the majority of records created using MS Teams will be considered transitory, the specific retention and disposition requirements of an MS Teams site will depend on the purposes of the site and the type of records created and stored on the site.\nRefer to the\nRecords Retention Schedules and Disposition Authorities\n(RRSDAs) and\nOfficial, Transitory and Personal Records: A Guide for SFU Employees.\nfor additional information about retention and disposition requirements.\nTips\nOnce collaboration has been completed, ensure that records are saved in your departments record keeping system.\nBe aware that when a Channel is deleted, any files shared within the channel are still stored in the associated SharePoint library connected to the Teams Site. Therefore, administrators need to delete all documents from the library which are not meant to be retained as records.\nRecords on Teams sites should not be retained longer that what is outlined in the RRSDAs.\nGet into the habit of doing routine disposition checks, during which you delete files you no longer need and save those that you do need to keep to your department’s records repository.\nCreate channels with a known conclusion in mind; this makes it easier to set aside a specific date for capturing and transferring records.\nAccess and Privacy\nAll information created or received in MS Teams is subject to access requests under the\nFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA)\nand must be produced in the case of a FOIPPA access request, this includes messages shared in chats and channels.\nPrior to launch, a privacy impact assessment was completed for MS Teams. However, when using Teams it is still best practice to limit the sharing of sensitive or confidential information just as you would with any other communication tool.\nAdditional Resources\nSee\nMicrosoft Teams\nfor more information.\nRelated Articles (2)\nFile ownership in a team vs. a chat\nThis article describes the file ownership in a team and chat on Microsoft Teams.\nRecommended Usage for File Storage and Collaboration\nLearn more about the differences between Microsoft Teams and OneDrive for file storage and collaboration.\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nMicrosoft Teams\nMicrosoft Teams (MS Teams) is a virtual collaboration app that brings together Microsoft 365 services (such as Office and OneDrive) to keep you virtually connected to the SFU community from anywhere at any time.",

To view the original publication, visit:\nhttps://www.sfu.ca/archives/records-management/links-resources1.html\nThis Article Includes:\nM365 and the Records Management Lifecycle\nManaging Records in OneDrive\nIntroduction\nOneDrive is a document hosting and synchronization service that has been provided to SFU faculty, staff, and students as part SFUs Microsoft 365 (M365) installation. When used as described in this guideline, OneDrive can reduce reliance on email, facilitate document sharing, enable remote access, and support document synchronization.\nThis guideline provides SFU employees with resources to help organize, manage, retain, and dispose of the documents they store and share in their OneDrive accounts in accordance with records management best practice.\nM365 AND THE RECORDS MANAGEMENT LIFECYCLE\nThe\nrecords management lifecycle\nis framework that describes the distinct phases of a record’s existence, from creation to final disposition. At SFU, there are several different tools that individuals and departments can use to create, use, maintain, and retain records.\nOneDrive\nallows account holders to securely store, share and synchronise their individual files and folders from any device. OneDrive can be used during the\ncreation\nand\nuse\nphase of the records management lifecycle.\nMS Teams\nis a communication and collaborative tool. MS Teams can be used during the\ncreation\nand\nuse\nphase of the records management lifecycle. For more information see MS Teams Best Practices.\nOnce records reach the\nmaintenance\nand\nretention\nphase of their lifecycle, they can be transferred into a shared records repository (such as a Shared Network Drives, ERMS, etc.) or they can continue to be managed in place in Teams. More guidance about records repositories is in development. Please visit the\nRecords Management Links and Resources\npage for more information.\nAs ITS continues to introduce new Microsoft 365 services, additional tools for managing electronic records, such as SharePoint Online, will be made available. For more information see\nMicrosoft 365 at SFU Roadmap\n.\nManaging Records in OneDrive\nOneDrive is not meant to be a central location for the long-term storage of official university records. OneDrive should be used as a place to draft and develop official university records. Official university records should be transferred to a central storage location (e.g., Share drive) or collaboration site (e.g., MS Teams) when they are ready for review and/or sharing. For more information about how to identify official university records, please see\nTransitory, Official and Personal Records: A Guide for SFU Employees\n.\nWhat to store in OneDrive\nWhat not to store in OneDrive\nIndividual research (e.g., published articles or other information for a future project)\nEarly drafts of documents not yet ready for review (e.g., working draft reports)\nDocuments meant to be accessed by a team (e.g., project revisions or planning documents).\nOfficial records (e.g., finalized university records, such as policies and procedures)\nPersonal information (e.g., holiday photographs, personal finances)\nCaution:\nPolicy development for all M365 products, including OneDrive is ongoing; and access to OneDrive post-employment is not guaranteed.\nTips for organizing your OneDrive\nSchedule a re-occurring time to review and clean up your OneDrive.\nEnsure that you regularly transfer official university records from your OneDrive to your department’s recordkeeping system.\nFollow a similar file naming convention in your OneDrive as used elsewhere by your department. For tips on file naming see\nStandard Naming Conventions for Electronic Records\n.\nKeep your folder structure simple, ideally no more than two levels of nesting folders.\nUse your department’s file classification plan to name folders according to a predefined taxonomy. For tips on creating a file classification plan see\nModel File Classification Plan for University Records\n.\nPrior to leaving the university or transferring positions (e.g., moving from Department X to Department Y), transfer official university records to your department’s repository and save any personal information about you as an employee (e.g., your resume) or your individual research to your personal storage space outside of the SFU environment (e.g., your personal OneDrive, iCloud, etc.).\nTips for document sharing\nAll documents stored in OneDrive remain linked to their original owner. If you leave SFU and your account is deactivated, the original documents will be difficult to recover if they have not already been stored elsewhere, regardless of whether they have been shared or not.\nYou may share documents stored in OneDrive; however, be aware that anyone who is granted access to a document in OneDrive with editing privileges can share that file with others. If you anticipate a document needing to be accessed and/or shared by a large group of people, move it to an MS Teams site or other shared repository instead of keeping it in OneDrive.\nPlease note that extensive sharing through OneDrive will create a complicated network of permissions since unique permissions will be set for each individual document and/or folder that is shared.\nFinally, be aware, that documents shared in private chat in MS Teams will be stored in your OneDrive account.\nOther Resources\nSee\nMicrosoft OneDrive\nmore information.\nRelated Articles (1)\nRecommended Usage for File Storage and Collaboration\nLearn more about the differences between Microsoft Teams and OneDrive for file storage and collaboration.\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nMicrosoft OneDrive\nMicrosoft OneDrive is a file hosting and synchronization service for individual use at the university.",

    "clean_body_text": "Information Security\nIdentity and Access Management\nGroup Management\nOVERVIEW\nThis article describes the feature differences between SFU Groups and SFU Maillist.\nCHANGED FEATURES\nThe following features will not be available in SFU Groups (when compared to SFU Maillist):\nSFU Groups\nOwner role\nOwner role has merged with manager role. This is to ensure that group ownership isn't tied to an individual and become stale.\nDeliver Mail to Members by Default\nAlways on. Users can no longer turn off email delivery from Exchange Distribution Groups they belong in.\nNote\n: Managers won't receive emails if they are not a member of the group.\nDelivery Suspended\nNo longer available. Users can no longer turn off email delivery from Exchange Distribution Groups they belong in.\nWelcome Message\nNo longer available.\nChange Log\nOnly available to IT admins.\nDelivery History\nNo longer available.\nSender Restriction\n(Allow List)\nStays available, but emails sent to a sender restricted Distribution Groups have additional security requirements.\nWith Exchange Distribution Groups, this will require any sender to authenticate to Exchange. This means that users will need to be signed into an\nSFU's Approved Email Application\nin order to send emails to an Exchange Distribution Group with Restricted Senders.\nIf the sender has not authenticated to Exchange, they will receive a bounce-back message saying their email has not been delivered. In most cases, this applies to those you use IMAP/POP (except for Thunderbird with OAuth2), any unapproved email applications, and any unapproved\nemail integrations with M365\n.\nMigration Impact Note\n:\nAfter migrating these maillists to Exchange Distribution Groups, this setting will be turned\noff\nby default.\nIf you wish to continue having restricted senders on your Distribution Group, you will need to re-enable this setting.\nOnly course/plan groups will have their Restricted Sender settings migrated.\nMaillist Nesting\nSince the permissions model is different in SFU Groups, all owners of groups that contain a nested group will require Group Reader Permissions to that nested group.\nMigration Impact Note\n:\nSince the permissions model is different in SFU Groups, if you are an owner of a maillist with a nested maillist, you will now require Reader or Manager Permissions to that nested maillist when maillists are migrated over as Exchange Distribution Groups.\nExample:\ndept-managers-all\nunit-a-managers\n(nested maillist)\nunit-b-managers\n(nested maillist)\njane_doe@sfu.ca\n(owner)\njohn_doe@sfu.ca\n(member)\nIn this example, Jane Doe is an owner of\ndept\n-managers-all\n.\nJane Doe now requires Reader or Manager permissions for\nunit-a-managers\nand\nunit-b-managers\nin SFU Groups.\nMy nested maillist are within my department\nIf you also happen to be the owner of that nested maillist, you don't need to take additional action. If the nested maillist is not owned or managed by you, you should get manager role for that maillist prior to migration for a seamless transition to SFU Groups.\nBe sure to check on the\nActive Maillist Migration List\nto see if you have any maillists that have \"nested non-owned lists\". Contact the maillist owners of those \"nested non-owned lists\" for manager role to those nested maillists.\nMy nested maillist are cross-department\nIf the nested maillist is owned by someone from another department, you should get manager role for that maillist prior to migration for a seamless transition to SFU Groups.\nBe sure to check on the\nActive Maillist Migration List\nto see if you have any maillists that have \"nested non-owned lists\". Contact the maillist owners of those \"nested non-owned lists\" for manager role to those nested maillists.\nNested maillist from another department where they haven't been migrated yet:\nYour nested maillist will be\nautomatically removed\nfrom the membership list.\nOnce removed from the membership list, you will need to wait until the other department has also migrated. If you followed the steps above prior to migration, you should have manager role to the remove nested maillist. Simply re-add the nested maillist on SFU Groups.\nNested maillist from another department where they already migrated:\nIf you followed the steps above prior to migration, you should have the correct privileges to the nested maillist on SFU Groups. You don't need to take additional action.\nSelf-subscribe or unsubscribe\nNo longer available. Use\nSimpleList\nif you require this feature.\nDelays\nIf you are making changes to Exchange Distribution Groups or security groups linked to a Microsoft service (e.g., Teams, SharePoint), you will need to wait an additional\n30 minutes\nfor your changes to fully sync to Microsoft servers.\nADDED FEATURES\nThe following features will be new to SFU Groups (on Grouper):\nSFU Groups\nComposite Groups (dynamically generated groups)\nOnly available to IT admins\nCreating Permissions and Attributes\nOnly available to IT admins\nInherited Permissions and Attributes\nOnly available to IT admins\nRole Permissions and Privileges Automation\nOnly available to IT admins\nAudit Logs\nOnly available to IT admins\nGroup Types and Folders\nOnly available to IT admins\nAttestation and Group Validation\nOnly available to IT admins\n* IT admins refers to those who have access to the full Grouper interface, which may include members of the local IT administrators and other technical group managers.\nNEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT?\nFor questions about Group Management or SFU Groups:\nVisit our\nSFU Groups FAQ\n.\nFor additional assistance:\nRequest a support ticket using\nGroup Management - Submit Question or Inquiry\n.\nRelated Articles (1)\nService Migrations to SFU Groups (Grouper)\nSFU Maillist to SFU Groups migration tracking.\nRelated Services / Offerings (2)\nEmail Distribution Lists\nTools that provides the ability to send email messages to multiple email addresses using a list or a group.\nGroup Management\nGroup Management simplifies access management by letting you use the same group or role across many services at SFU.",

In the context of the Microsoft Power Platform, a DLP policy is a set of technical guidelines for how data can flow between different apps via connectors.\nWhat are connectors?\nConnectors\nare no-code/low-code components that provide a way for the\nMicrosoft Power Platform\nto communicate with other apps and services. When you set up a connector in a Power Automate workflow (also called \"flows\") or a Power Automate app, you are authorizing one service to talk to another.\nFor example, you could have an automated flow that starts an approval process when a file is uploaded to SharePoint by using the\nSharePoint Online\nand\nMS Approvals\nconnectors. In this case, each connector would be authorized to broker (or \"talk\") to each service so the flow can act on your behalf.\nConnectors are an empowering feature to enable personal productivity within Microsoft 365. If you are just getting started with connectors and want to learn more, explore the\nGet Started with Power Automate\nonline resources from Microsoft.\nWhy has SFU restricted some connectors?\nAccess to data within the SFU community is diverse. In combination with our community's\ndata responsibility guidelines\n, a baseline Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy is an automatic way of helping our community safely navigate connections between data using vetted (reviewed and approved) connectors, while avoiding the complications and risks that can lead to data abuse.\nIn general, the baseline DLP policy for the Microsoft Power Platform will restrict any connector that:\nHasn't undergone a privacy and security review (this includes new connectors).\nRequires a premium license to use.",

This process ensures the protection of sensitive information and mitigates the risk of data breaches.\nis a comprehensive program implemented by SFU to ensure the secure and environmentally responsible disposal of IT assets. By adhering to Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) and Computer Security Research Center (CSRC) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines, the university aims to protect sensitive data and contribute to ecological sustainability.\nAll university-funded devices are required to undergo the asset recycling and secure data disposal process, ensuring proper erasure of sensitive information. The procedures for managed and un-managed devices vary and are outlined below.\nManaged Devices\nUn-managed Devices\nManaged Devices\nManaged devices, which are typically issued and controlled by the university's IT department, follow a specific process for secure decommissioning and disposal.\nInform your local IT contact about the device you wish to dispose of. They will guide you through the appropriate decommissioning procedures.\nLAN-ADMIN LOGIN\nUn-managed Devices\nUn-managed devices, including personally owned computers or mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.), are not under the direct control of the university's IT department. These devices require user participation for secure decommissioning and disposal and require special attention due to their portability and the sensitive nature of the data they may contain.\nData Backup: Begin by backing up all important data from the mobile device. This step is crucial as it allows you to retain any personal or important information before proceeding with decommissioning.\nRemove Locks and Passcodes: Disable any locks, passcodes, or biometric authentication features on the mobile device. This is important to grant the IT team access to the device for processing and erasure.\nInform your IT Team: Contact your local IT representative and they will provide instructions and guidance for further steps.\nSIM Card and Memory Card Removal: Don't forget to remove the SIM card and any external memory cards from the mobile device. These items may contain personal information and should be disposed of separately or securely erased before being used elsewhere.\nSubmit a\nFacilities Service Request\nor email your local Facilities team.\nFacilities Requests\nBurnaby\nTo recycle your electronics at the Burnaby campus:\nSubmit a\nFacilities Service Request\n.\nSelect \"Routine Surplus Furniture and Equipment\".\nSpecify \"Electronic Equipment\" in the request section, including the number of items and/or totes.\nSurrey\nTo recycle your electronics at the Surrey campus, contact\nscfacil@sfu.ca\n.\nVancouver\nTo recycle your electronics at the Vancouver campus, contact\nfsvhelp@sfu.ca\n.\nResources\nSanitization and disposal of electronic devices\nGuidelines for Media Sanitization",

This upgrade aims to enhance IT security, improve user experience, and enabling access to Microsoft’s suite of products like OneDrive, Teams and SharePoint.\nBetween now and 2025, all SFU mailboxes will be upgrading to Exchange Online.\nThis article describes the SFU Mail changes coming with Exchange Online:\nNew Features\nSFU Mail on Browser\nOutlook on Desktop\nMicrosoft Teams and other M365 Apps\nNew Requirements\nDesktop Email Applications\nMobile Email Applications\nIMAP, SMTP and POP\nService Changes and Limits\nMailbox Storage Limit\nEmail Backup\nData Security\nCompatibility\nOlder Mobile Devices\nOlder Browsers\nNew Features\nSFU MAIL ON BROWSER\nNew and Mo\nderniz\ned Look\nFocused Inbox\nSweep and Archive Folder\nSnooze Feature\nScheduling Email Delivery\nImproved Search Function\nReport Junk/Phishing\nText Prediction,\nSuggestions for Meetings\nand\nSuggestions for Responses\nEnhanced File Previewing and Inline Video Playback\nEmail integrations with OneDrive, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams (e.g.,\nsuggested attachments\n)\nCalendar and Event time zone selector when scheduling for a different time zone.\nCalendar and Event integrations with Microsoft Teams for\nquicker online meeting scheduling\nCalendar and Event\nScheduling Polling\nto automatically schedule placeholders and administer voting for determine preferred dates/time\nCalendar and Event has integrated maps when event location is set to a specific address\nMicrosoft Bookings integration with calendar\nOUTLOOK ON DESKTOP\nWhen creating a new calendar event/meeting on Outlook on desktop, there will be additional settings to generate a Microsoft Teams meeting link.\nMICROSOFT TEAMS AND OTHER M365 APPS\nYour Microsoft Teams status is automatically set based on your SFU Outlook Calendar.\nNote\n: If you don't wish your status to appear \"busy\" during calendar events or meetings (that you own), be sure to change the \"Show as\" of the event to \"Free\".\nFor meetings you are tentatively attending or haven't accepted into your calendar, your status will appear \"free\" during those meetings.\nYour Microsoft Teams out-of-office message will automatically sync from your SFU Outlook automatic replies (out-of-office) and appear on your Microsoft Teams status.\nYour SFU Mail calendar is available directly on Microsoft Teams.\nNew Requirements\nWhy are there new requirements?\nAs technology evolves, it is crucial to continuously assess and adjust our IT standards in an evolving cybersecurity landscape. The updates to SFU IT standards are aligned with\nWhat’s Next: The SFU Strategy\nand\nSFU’s digital transformation goals\n, and are designed to enhanced cybersecurity measures and protect research, academic, and business data across the university.\nWith the addition of Exchange Online, every third-party application that connects to SFU Mail is considered a “system integration”. This requires SFU to update IT security and compliance standards to comply with provincial privacy requirements. Each of these systems integrations requires a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and a Security Assessment.\nCan I use my personal email app to access SFU Mail?\nOnly third party tools approved for use by a University-supported initiative and backed by Privacy Impact and Security assessments will be enabled for SFU Mail access. Personal productivity and personal preferences for workflow aren't sufficient to allow third party tools that consume SFU email or calendar data.\nWe encourage you to try Microsoft Outlook to access SFU Mail, as it's SFU's fully supported email client for personal desktop and mobile use while providing the most seamless experience.\nMy App is critical for research, learning, or other university business needs. How do I get my app approved?\nIf you believe that your third-party application is critical for research, learning, or other university business needs, visit\nExternal Apps/Tool Changes and FAQs\nfor details on getting your application approved by IT Services.\nNote\n: Exact timing will vary depending on your role at the university and will coincide with your mailbox migration to Exchange Online. Be sure to prepare any changes to your personal or business work flows.\nAPPROVED DESKTOP EMAIL APPLICATIONS\nBelow are the approved desktop email applications that can connect to SFU Mail:\nOutlook for PC and Mac\n(this application is recommended and fully supported by the university)\nApple Mail\nMozilla Thunderbird w/ TBSync Plug-in (alternatively, OWL Plug-in via OWA protocol)\nNo other applications will be able to connect to SFU Mail.\nNote\n: Outlook for PC is part of Microsoft 365, which is only available to current SFU staff, faculty and students. Alternatively,\nOutlook on Web Browser\nis available to all SFU Mail users.\nAPPROVED MOBILE EMAIL APPLICATIONS\nBelow are the approved mobile email applications that can connect to SFU Mail:\nOutlook for Android and iOS\n(this application is recommended and fully supported by the university)\nApple Mail\nGmail (Android only)*\nSamsung Mail\nNo other applications will be able to connect to SFU Mail.\n*\nGmail for iOS currently does not support Modern Authentication (OAuth2). You will see \"Incorrect username or password\" when attempting to sign into Gmail on iOS until the vendor implements support.\nIMAP, SMTP AND POP\nBelow are changes on connecting to SFU Mail through protocols:\nIMAP, SMTP and POP configurations will require the OAuth2 or \"Modern Authentication\" authentication method to connect to SFU Mail once you are upgraded to Exchange Online. Additionally, such connections need to come from\nan approved application\n.\nPOP configurations are not recommended since most clients automatically delete old messages which may be unintended. We strongly recommend you switch to another connection method.\nSince many applications don't support the new security requirement, OAuth2, you\nmay need to switch to another application or connection method\n.\nIMAP, SMTP and POP connections will need to be\nreconfigured to a new server\n.\nFor details, see\nIMAP/SMTP Setup\n.\nTHIRD-PARTY TOOLS AND INTEGRATIONS\nThird-party tools and integrations refers to applications connected to SFU Mail that\nsync or modify your SFU Mail inbox, calendar, or contacts\n. For instance, any tools/applications that connect to your SFU Mail account for activities like: Event or meeting booking (e.g. Calendly, Doodle AG), Project coordination (e.g. Asana), Productivity tools (e.g. Notability).\nSFU Mail will only connect to\nthird-party apps/tools that are approved by IT Services\nfor SFU’s teaching-, research-, or business-critical activities, and are secure and compliant with provincial privacy regulations.\nExisting connections between SFU Mail and non-approved external tools/applications will stop working. The exact timing will coincide with the migration of your\nSFU mailbox to SFU’s new upgraded email system, Exchange Online\n. You will receive an email notification in advance of this migration.\nVisit\nExternal Apps/Tools Changes and FAQs\nfor details on upcoming changes in Summer 2024.\nService Changes and Limits\nMAILBOX STORAGE LIMIT\nBy moving to a cloud-based environment, Exchange Online has introduced new service limits to all mailbox storage. These mailbox storage limits are determined by your SFU account's Microsoft licensing. As a general guideline, the following are:\nSFU faculty\nand\nstaff\nand other users who are eligible for\nOffice 365\n(such as sponsored accounts with A3 Licensing) have a mailbox storage limit of\n100 GB\nSFU students\nhave a mailbox storage limit of\n5 GB\nSFU retirees\n,\nemeritus\n,\nadjunct professors\n, and other users who are eligible for\nOffice 365 online\n(such as sponsored accounts with standard licensing) have a mailbox storage limit of\n5\n0 GB\nNote\n: If your mailbox is reaching these storage limits, evaluate your use of SFU Mail and efforts to reducing the volume of email stored. You may need to reconsider if an email system is the appropriate place for storage of the information currently being kept there.\nEMAIL BACKUP\nExchange Online has accident prevention features, such as soft-deletes (\nDeleted Items or \"Trash bin\"\n) and item recovery (\nRecover Deleted Items\n). To ensure efficient use of resourcing, neither Microsoft nor SFU provide indefinite backups to user data caused by personal mistakes.\nIf you have accidentally deleted an item recently, you may be able to recover them. For more details, visit the Microsoft Support page on\nRecover Deleted Items\nin Outlook.\nNote\n: If your mailbox requires additional data resiliency, you are responsible for backing up your data.\nDATA SECURITY\nExchange Online (or SFU Mail) at SFU is protected by the enterprise-level security from Microsoft. Microsoft also provides the following to SFU Mail:\nData access to files and folders on a user’s Exchange Online Mailbox is only limited to the user account,\nData replication of core user data to at least two geographically distributed Microsoft data center for disaster recovery purposes, and\nEncryption of data in transit and at rest.\nTo learn more about Microsoft’s trust and security related information, visit the\nMicrosoft Trust Center\n.\nCompatibility\nOLDER MOBILE DEVICES\nIn order to connect to SFU Mail, your device will need to have a mail application that supports Microsoft's Modern Authentication (OAuth2).\nThe following is a list of email applications that support Modern Authentication and its operating system:\nOutlook Mobile\nAndroid 8+ (i.e., Samsung Galaxy S7 and newer)\niOS 15+ (i.e., iPhone 6S or newer)\nApple Mail\nMac OS X 10.14\niPadOS 13.1\niOS 11+ (i.e., iPhone 5S or newer)\nGmail for Android only\nAndroid 5.0+ (i.e., Samsung Galaxy S5 and newer)\nSamsung Mail\nAndroid 8+ (i.e., Samsung Galaxy S7 and newer)\nIf your device does not support Modern Authentication, you will either need to upgrade or switch to another device. If that's not possible, you may use\nSFU Mail through a web browser\n.\nOLDER BROWSERS\nGenerally speaking, unsupported browsers would be browsers versions with a release date prior to 2018. Visiting SFU Mail on an unsupported browser will display a\nlight version of Outlook\n.\nDetails for support browsers and minimum requirements for SFU Mail (powered by Outlook on the web) can be found on Microsoft's page about\nSupported browsers for Outlook on the web\n.\nEncountering issues? Visit our\nSFU Mail Migration FAQs and Common Issues\n.\nLooking for further support? Send a support ticket using the\nSFU Mail - Report Migration Issue\nform.",

Microsoft also provides the following to SFU Mail:\nData access to files and folders on a user’s Exchange Online Mailbox is only limited to the user account,\nData replication of core user data to at least two geographically distributed Microsoft data center for disaster recovery purposes, and\nEncryption of data in transit and at rest.\nTo learn more about Microsoft’s trust and security related information, visit the\nMicrosoft Trust Center\n.\nWhy is mail.sfu.ca becoming outdated?\nThe current SFU Mail weblink,\nhttps://mail.sfu.ca\n, will continue to work even after upgrading to Exchange Online. However, you may encounter some issues with the redirects to Outlook,\nhttps://outlook.office.com\n, where your browser settings, certificates and cookies may cause problems.\nBe sure to use\nhttps://outlook.office.com\nfor the most seamless experience.\nWhen I try to connect to SFU Mail on mobile, I see a \"Device Administrator\" Prompt. What is this?\nThe prompt, including the listed permissions, is\nstandard messaging when an Exchange account is connected\nto an email server with controls in place. In this case, SFU Mail has cybersecurity rules imposed by Exchange ActiveSync to enforce a consistent level of security and controls across connected devices.\nSFU IT administrators do not have such capabilities on your personal devices\n.\nAll users of SFU systems are bound by GP-24 which outlines appropriate use and access to electronic records, and IT staff are given appropriate role-based access to perform the work necessary for only their job function; accessing data on a personal device without user consent would be a violation of that policy.\nActivating Device Administrator allows Exchange to enforce cybersecurity rules onto your device for it to operate securely within the SFU environment (i.e., signing into SFU using your computing ID and MFA), and conversely, allowing your device to access SFU-related data, such as role and contact information on SFU's Exchange GAL, through a secure connection.\nEXTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY APPS/TOOLS\nCan I use my personal Email app to access SFU Mail?\nOnly third party tools approved for use by a University-supported initiative and backed by Privacy Impact and Security assessments will be enabled for SFU Mail access. Personal productivity and personal preferences for workflow aren't sufficient to allow third party tools that consume SFU email or calendar data.\nWe encourage you to try Microsoft Outlook to access SFU Mail, as it's SFU's fully supported email client for personal desktop and mobile use while providing the most seamless experience.\nMy App is critical for research, learning, or other university business needs. How do I get my app approved?\nIf you believe that your third-party application is critical for research, learning, or other university business needs, visit\nExternal Apps/Tool Changes and FAQs\nfor details on getting your application approved by IT Services.\nCan I use IMAP/POP with my Email application?\nYou can only connect to SFU Mail through IMAP/POP with select applications. Email applications will require OAuth2 authentication method and approved by IT Services (enabled by an Exchange IT Administrator) for it to connect to SFU Mail. Unless you are using this connection/app for teaching-, research- or business-critical activities, we recommend switching to a modern connection method.\nVisit\nIMAP/SMTP Setup\nfor details.\nI can't sign into my application, even though it's approved. What should i Do?\nEnsure that your application is up to date on the latest version. Older versions may not support Exchange Online requirements and cause this error.\nLooking for technical details on changes to third-party applications connected to SFU Mail?

If you have a device managed by the university, it may come with a version of Office apps that do not require a sign-in (often called \"device based licensing\") which will prevent you from using Microsoft 365 Copilot in those apps. Check with your IT team if they can switch to the sign-in version of Office apps or let you install the\nMicrosoft 365 versions\n.\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot isn't showing in the web version of Office apps.\nDepending on your preferred web browser, it may be blocking Copilot.

This comprehensive step removes ALL printers and queues. Along with clearing all Keychain entries associated with printing, ensure that the PaperCut client is installed and operational.\nFollow the provided instructions diligently. When specifying the URL for the queue, make the following adjustment:\nChange: smb://sfuprint-p.mps.sfu.ca/SFU_Print_non_AD_auth\nTo: smb://sfuprint-p.mps.sfu.ca/SFU_Print_non_AD_auth?encryption=no\nThis adjustment should help mitigate the printing interruptions experienced previously.\nIt is one continuous line, without breaks. After adding the printer, you can perform a test print, and the printer authentication prompt should appear. I utilized \"ADSFU\\<username>\" and encountered no issues.\nNext is Papercut authentication\nand finally, information that our job is waiting for us in papercut queue\nHope this helps.",

You will receive an email notification in advance of this migration.\nWho does this affect?\nAny member of the SFU community (faculty, staff, researcher, student, sponsored/role account, etc.) using non-approved external tools or applications that connect to SFU Mail for email or calendar-related activities. For instance, any tools/applications that connect to your SFU Mail account for activities like:\nEvent or meeting booking (e.g. Calendly, Doodle AG)\nProject coordination (e.g. Asana)\nProductivity tools (e.g. Notability)\nContact management tools (e.g. HubSpot)\nEmail add-ins/plug-ins\nEmail clients (desktop or mobile applications)\nAny other connections that sync with or change your SFU Mail inbox/calendar or Exchange contacts\nNot sure if this affects you?\nDo a self-check to see if this impacts you\n(1-3 min.)\nNext Steps\nTo ensure minimal disruptions to your workflows, take one of the following actions:\nReview\nto see if your tool/application is already on\nSFU’s list of approved external tools and applications\n. If it is, you do not need to take any further action. Your SFU Mail connections will continue to work.\nOR\nDiscontinue using\nthe third-party application/tool and switch to an\nSFU-approved tool/application\nor find an alternative way to get your work done without connecting SFU Mail to the unapproved app/tool.\nOR\nRequest\nIT Services approval to connect your external/tool to SFU Mail.\nComplete and submit this request form\nto initiate a request with IT Services.\n(\nNote\n: Only for tools that are critical for research, learning, or other university business needs. Not applicable to tools used for individual preferences.)\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhy is SFU updating its IT standards?\nAs technology evolves, it is crucial to continuously assess and adjust our IT standards in an evolving cybersecurity landscape. The updates to SFU IT standards are aligned with\nWhat’s Next: The SFU Strategy\nand\nSFU’s digital transformation goals\n, and are designed to enhanced cybersecurity measures and protect research, academic, and business data across the university.\nSFU is upgrading our email system to Exchange Online for better features and stronger security. As part of this change, every third-party application that connects to SFU Mail is considered a “system integration”. According to provincial requirements and the new IT standards, each of these integrations requires a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and a Security Assessment.\nWhat are the key changes starting Summer 2024?\nStarting in the Summer of 2024, SFU Mail will only connect with third-party apps/tools that have received a PIA and Security Assessment and have been approved for use in SFU's business, teaching, or research-critical activities. Any existing connections between SFU Mail and non-approved external tools/applications will stop working when your SFU Mail account is migrated to Exchange Online.\nWho will be affected by these changes?\nThe changes will impact any member of the SFU community (e.g. staff, faculty, researchers, students, sponsored/role accounts, etc.) who currently use a third-party/external tool or application that connects to their SFU Mail for email or calendar-related activities. This includes, but is not limited to, tools and applications that access your SFU Mail information:\nEvent or meeting booking (e.g. Calendly, Doodle AG)\nProject coordination (e.g. Asana)\nProductivity tools (e.g. Notability)\nContact management tools (e.g. HubSpot)\nEmail plug-ins/add-ins\nEmail clients (desktop or mobile applications)\nAny other connections that sync with or change your SFU Mail inbox/calendar or Exchange contacts\nNot sure if this affects you?\nDo a self-check to see if this impacts you\n(1-3 min.)\nWhich third-party tools or applications can be requested for approval?\nAny external tool or application that is critical for SFU’s teaching, research, or general business functions can be requested for approval. For example:\nAn application that sends emails using an SFU email account.\nSoftware that connects to your advising team’s mailboxes to manage appointment bookings, used for coordinating student advising.\nExternal tools or apps that will not be considered for approval (or for delay to SFU Mail migration) are typically used for personal preferences. For example:\nA calendar app on your phone is used for convenience to view all your SFU Mail calendar information\nA personal productivity tool that organizes and schedules tasks/events on your SFU Mail calendar\nHow do I know if an external tool/application is approved for university use?\nVisit our webpage on\nIntegrations with Microsoft 365\nto view approved applications. If your external tool/app is not listed on that webpage, it hasn’t been approved and will not work with SFU Mail on Exchange Online.\nWhat is the approval process?\nTo have a third-party tool or application approved to integrate with SFU Mail, it should be\ncritical for the university’s teaching, research, or business operations\n. This process does not apply to tools chosen based on personal preference.\nTo request approval to use an email client (desktop or mobile):\nSubmit a request to IT Services\n.\nA Security Assessment will be needed to determine if your Email Client can be approved. IT Services will provide further information after you submit your request.\nTo request approval for a connection to a third-party app/tool:\nSubmit a request to IT Services\n. This will initiate a review with IT Services, and you will be contacted with more information.\nIf your request proceeds, you will need to either:\nUpdate an existing\nPrivacy Impact Assessment\nand Security Assessment for compatibility with Exchange Online.\nInitiate a new\nPrivacy Impact Assessment\nand Security Assessment through Archives and Records Management. The time required varies; typically, it ranges from 1-6 months, but could be longer due to high demand in Summer 2024.\nAfter your Privacy Impact Assessment and Security Assessments are complete,\nsubmit your app/tool integration request to IT Services\n.\nLooking for FAQs on SFU Mail Upgrade?

    "clean_body_text": "Students\nHow-To Guides\nOverview\nThis article describes how to preserve your email messages as you graduate or transition away from studying or working at the university.\nWhat happens to my emails after leaving SFU?\nWhy use Mozilla Thunderbird?\nPART A. Install Thunderbird and sync your SFU Mail\nPART B: Copy your SFU Mail messages to another location\nTroubleshooting Tips\nWhat happens to my emails after leaving SFU?\nIf you are a\nstudent (includes Alumni), staff, or faculty member leaving SFU for any reason other than retirement,\nyour SFU Computing account will be converted into an\nSFU Limited Access ID account\none year after your last active term (student) or end date (staff/faculty). Consequently, your SFU Mail account will be destroyed and its contents will no longer be recoverable. IT Services will send an email reminder 90 days, 45 days and 30 days prior to contents being removed.\nSetup instructions have been provided for the Thunderbird email client which is available for free on Windows, Mac, and Linux.\nHow many emails do you have?\nIf you have a small number of emails you'd like to keep, consider manually forwarding them to your personal email. We also recommend cleaning up your inbox to reduce the number of items that need to be downloaded and transferred over.\nWhy use Mozilla Thunderbird?\nMozilla Thunderbird is a free, open-source application that is available to everyone on Windows, Mac and Linux. Other applications, such as Outlook, may require licensing that may no longer be available after leaving the university.\nIf you still have access to Outlook for Desktop and more comfortable with Outlook, consider visiting Microsoft Support on\nExport emails, contacts, and calendar items\nto preserve email content.\nAlternatively, if you have a preference on using another email application, you can transfer or export your email messages using any of the\napproved email applications\nwithin the grace period.\nPART A. Install Thunderbird and sync your SFU Mail\nSTEP 1. Install Thunderbird\nVisit the\nThunderbird website\nto download the latest version of the Thunderbird email client for your computer.\nSTEP 2. Setup SFU Mail on Thunderbird\nTo set up your SFU Mail account on Thunderbird, see\nour guide for signing into Thunderbird\n.\nOnce all folders are populated, they will continue to sync with your SFU Mail account as messages are sent, received or moved. There is a progress bar at the bottom of the window to indicate how many messages are being downloaded from the email server. If you don't see all your folders, see our\ntroubleshooting tips\n.\nDepending on your internet connection and the number of messages you have, the download process can take upwards of several hours. Allow the downloading of messages to be fully complete before proceeding to the next step.\nPART B: Copy your SFU Mail messages to another location\nSTEP 3. Determine if you want to copy your messages to another platform or save them locally on your computer\nAfter setting up your SFU account on Thunderbird and downloading all your messages, you'll need to determine where you'd like to save a copy of your messages for future access:\nOn another email platform, such as Gmail\nLocally on your computer, in the Local Folders mailbox in Thunderbird\nCopying your messages to another email has the benefit of allowing you to access these messages on your preferred platform. However, it can take a significant amount of time for the third-party email server to complete the transfer process.\nLooking for resources to setup your personal email account on Thunderbird?\nThunderbird uses IMAP to connect to other email providers. Here are some resources from popular email providers:\nGmail:\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-and-gmail\nOutlook:\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/set-up-email-in-mozilla-thunderbird-8-0-f4726a9e-64d3-4494-9260-5762597fd1a6\nApple Mail (iCloud):\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/102525\nCopying your messages to the local mailbox on Thunderbird can be done more quickly. However, you'll only be able to access these messages locally on the computer you completed the setup with.\nSTEP 4. Save a copy of your messages\nWe recommend creating a new folder on your third-party email platform or local folders mailbox (right click \"Local Folders\" > New Folder...) to copy your messages over. Then use the copy function (right click > Copy to >\nmailbox folder name\n) to copy messages or folders over to the other mailbox.\nAfter transferring your messages, you may wish to keep Thunderbird installed until your mailbox expires.\nFIPPA Considerations for Staff and Faculty Members\nDepending on the content within your SFU email messages, the storage of those messages on external email servers hosted outside of Canada can be a potential violation of BC FIPPA. Should you wish to migrate messages from your SFU email account, transfer them to the Local Folders mailbox within Thunderbird.\nFor more information on BC FIPPA, visit\nhttps://www.sfu.ca/archives/foipop.html\nTroubleshooting Tips\nIf the folders are still not showing,\ntry collapsing and expanding the list using the \"arrow\" beside the account name\n(e.g., \"demo1@sfu.ca\"). When the arrow is clicked again to expand the list, your folders should now be displayed. Note that the folder contents may still be in the process of being transferred, and you may need to click on each folder to ensure that the transfer is still being carried out.\nIf you have completed the above and are still not seeing your folders show,\nyou may need to subscribe to the mailboxes:\nClick the\nSettings\nicon and navigate to\nPreferences > Account Settings\n.\nSelect\nSynchronization & Storage\nand click the\nAdvanced...\nbutton.\nClick the arrow beside the account name to expand the list of folders. You will also see a Download column with dots (not downloaded) and checkmarks (downloaded). If needed,\nclick the dots\nunder the Download column for the folders you wish to download. Once done, click\nOK\n.\nThose folders should now show up under your account in the Mailbox screen.",

Privacy protections align with global standards like GDPR and ISO/IEC 27018.\nSFU organizational policies apply\n: Copilot respects your existing access controls (such as sensitivity labels and sharing permissions) so you're in control of the content you want share with it. If you haven't provided access to something, Copilot won't have access to it either.\nYou're guarded against AI risks\n: Protections are in place to help prevent harmful content, prompt injections, and copyright issues, so you can use Copilot confidently.\nYour data powers your experience, not the AI model\n: Prompts, responses, and data are accessed through the same mechanism (Microsoft Graph) that protects your emails and content to generate relevant answers for you, but are not used to train foundation models.\nInterested in learning more? See more details about:\nData Privacy and Security for Copilot Chat\nData Privacy and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot\nResponsible Use of Copilot at SFU\nAs you use Copilot (or any AI solution) it's important to keep in mind that these tools are designed to be very human-like but are not human. They may not consider the same ethical implications or commitments that you might have and do not have the same responsibilities.\nDuring your interactions, you should remain critical of results while understanding the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of these tools. Below, are several guiding principals from an SFU perspective that can help you responsibly engage with AI. Also see our\ndeep-dive\ninto these topics so you can use AI in a confident and thoughtful way.\nS.A.F.E-A.I.\nSecure\nAI systems must protect personal data and be built with strong safeguards against unauthorized access. Security ensures that information is handled responsibly throughout the system’s lifecycle and that robust security controls are in place to prevent abuse.\nUse only university-reviewed systems when entering personal information into AI tools, to ensure compliance with institutional privacy and security standards.\nConduct\nPrivacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)\nfor new AI solutions, and update PIAs if they have significantly changed.\nApply security safeguards proportional to\ndata sensitivity\n.\nWhile evaluating AI solutions, choose privacy-protective technologies.\nAccountable\nOrganizations must remain answerable for how AI systems are developed and used. This includes ensuring decisions can be traced, data is used legally, and people — not machines — are ultimately responsible.\nYou remain accountable for content generated by AI solutions you use, including the impacts of its use elsewhere.\nResponses from AI generated content must not be treated as a source of authority.\nIf you are an SFU employee, do not use AI to collect personal information from public sources (such as websites, social media...etc.) except where specifically authorized and only after informing the individuals whose data is being collected.\nUnderstand that when AI generates information about a specific person—even if it's guessed or inferred—it still counts as personal data and must be handled according to privacy laws.\nEnsure that any personal information entered into AI systems is handled in accordance with the original Collection Notice and relevant privacy obligations, including the\nFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy ActLinks to an external site.\nor applicable university policies for your area.\nWhen considering AI solutions identify the impacts they could have on individuals or groups. Evaluate if it will be necessary for your purpose and not merely convenient.\nFair\nAI should treat individuals equitably and avoid bias in outcomes. Fairness means ensuring that no group is unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by automated decisions.\nEnsure the content you curate while using AI does not amplify biases or violate human rights, accessibility, or fairness obligations you have at the university.\nExplainable\n(Transparency)\nTransparency in AI builds trust and enables scrutiny. Users must be able to understand how AI systems work, verify their outputs, and justify decisions informed by AI.\nYou are responsible for verifying responses provided by AI. If you are unable to verify and explain results, then consider not using them.\nYou remain responsible for the execution and transparency of decisions informed or made by AI Solutions.\nEnsure AI generated content doesn't falsely impersonate or misrepresent you, others, or any other additional commitments you have (such as copyrighted content).\nBe transparent when others are interacting with AI generated content created vs. human generated content.\nMark outputs with significant impact as AI-generated.\nClearly inform people when AI is used in decision-making, with recourse options available.\nAuditable\n(Safety & Reliability)\nAI systems must be regularly reviewed to ensure reliability and safety. Auditing allows issues to be identified early and supports responsible oversight and continuous improvement.\nIf you are using an AI solution, ensure results or content it generates adheres to legal commitments, code of ethics, or other responsibilities you have in your role at the university. It will be incumbent on you to audit your use of AI in a reliable and safe manner. AI itself cannot take responsibility.\nWhen developing and supporting AI solutions that will be used by others, understand your responsibility to maintain them in a reliable and safe manner. Establish regular audits and testing to ensure your AI solution does not cause harm (such as disinformation, hate speech, or violent/illegal instructions).\nRemain informed about the limitations of AI solutions you use and assess whether they are suitable for your use. AI systems can provide inaccurate results if they aren't built for your context.\nInclusive\nAI systems should be designed to serve people of all backgrounds and abilities. Inclusivity means considering diverse needs to promote accessibility, representation, and equal participation.\nPrioritize AI solutions that are designed to be accessible and supportive of people with diverse abilities, ensuring everyone can use and benefit from them.\nAvoid AI marginalizing groups or individuals; ensure datasets and outputs reflect diversity and equity.\nLearn more about\nresponsible AI in our deep-dive article\n.\nData hygiene while using Copilot\nWhen you're using Microsoft 365 and tools like Copilot, it's easy to forget how much information you're actually sharing and storing. That’s why it’s important to keep your data clean and organized. By being mindful about how you share files, label sensitive content, and manage old documents, you can make sure you're working safely and smartly. Here are a few simple ways to stay on top of your data hygiene while using Microsoft 365.\nGuarding Against Oversharing\nMicrosoft 365 is a great platform for collaboration and productivity, however, content owners may inadvertently share more content than they need (often called \"\nOversharing\n\"). It will be important to consider the following when sharing content on the Microsoft 365 platform:\nPick the right level of access for each link you make when you share a document. For example, you can share your work with\nanyone, only with people in your organization, or only the people you choose\n.\nIf you create \"Anyone\" links that can be shared publicly, set an\nexpiry date on the link\n. This means that your links will stop working after at time you define. This can help ensure that content isn't shared forever and reduces the burden of managing links overall.\nRegularly review your links using the\n\"My Content\"\nfeature in the M365 portal. Under the \"Shared\" tab, you can filter through all the links you've made and who can use them. You can also change or delete any links that you don't need or want anymore.\nFor an in-depth overview of how each link works while sharing information see:\nHow shareable links work in OneDrive and SharePoint in Microsoft 365\n.\nClassifying Sensitive Data\nAs an AI companion, Copilot Chat will be able to interact with documents and content that you share with it or have the permission to view while using \"Work\" mode with the\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot\nversion. As a result, it may review documents that contain sensitive information such as:\nPersonal Information: Such as names, addresses, phone numbers, personal email addresses, social security numbers, etc.\nConfidential or Sensitive Content: Including proprietary business information, financial details, legal documents, or any other information intended to be kept private\nFor documents that contain sensitive information, practice\nSFU's guidelines for data\n. This can include:\nData minimization\n: Where documents and content only contain the amount of data needed for a specific task.\nPrincipal of least privilege\n: Where data is only shared with other SFU employees in alignment with their role and duties.\nPracticing Data Lifecycle Management\nRegularly review and remove documents or content that are no longer needed in Microsoft 365. For documents that need to be archived and retained in the long term for legal reasons, store them in the appropriate location identified by your department. For example, store the final version of Word document in a network file-share or other system that has been identified as the archive space for your area.\nFor more guidance about file lifecycle management in Microsoft 365, see the following recommendations from the SFU Archives and Records Management department:\nFile lifecycle management in OneDrive\nFile lifecycle management in MS Teams\nAdvisory Notice from the SFU Privacy Office on the use of Microsoft 365 Copilot\nIn using this service, you agree to limit the upload, prompt, submission, or provision of access to documents or information that contains or includes personal (non-business contact information) or confidential information to this Microsoft 365 Copilot AI companion that is not strictly necessary. We urge all users to exercise caution and ensure that any personal information disclosed or used within the Microsoft 365 Copilot AI is done so in strict accordance with the Collection Notice under which the information was originally collected.\nFor greater clarity Personal Information: may include student names, private non-business addresses, non-work related phone numbers, non-work related email addresses, social security numbers, employment or education history, etc. For a more expansive list of personal information data elements please see: https://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/policies/files/information_policies/I10-11/I10.11 Schedule 1 - May 29 2021.pdf\nFor greater clarity Confidential or Sensitive Content: Including regulated data, proprietary business information, financial details, legal documents, or any other information that is confidential in nature regarding the university.\nPlease avoid relying on any responses from this Microsoft 365 Copilot AI companion to make decisions concerning individuals unless you have verified the accuracy of the information provided to, and statements provided by, this Microsoft 365 Copilot AI companion.\nShould you have any inquiries or concerns regarding the appropriate use of this platform, please contact the SFU Microsoft 365 team via the ITS Service Hub at\nhttps://servicehub.sfu.ca/\n.\nWe would like to caution users about the responsible use of Microsoft 365 Copilot AI. While AI enhances search and productivity capabilities, and user experience, it is essential to be mindful of its potential consequences. Please consider the following when providing prompts to the AI :\nEnsure that personal information entered into prompts is done in accordance with the Collection Notice under which that information was collected. If any personal information is entered, please ensure that it is handled responsibly, in accordance with any Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (RSBC 1996, c.165) and university policy related obligations you may have.\nAs AI can inadvertently amplify misinformation. Users should critically evaluate information and cross-reference information generated with reliable sources to verify the accuracy of search results.\nAI algorithms may unintentionally reflect biases. Be aware that search results can carry inherent biases, and it's crucial to critically evaluate information generated by AI.\nPlease be advised that all prompts entered into Microsoft 365 Copilot AI products, as well as the responses generated, are stored within the system regardless of how these responses are subsequently used or handled.\nIt is your responsibility to adhere to these guidelines to maintain the privacy and security of personal information you have access to.\nRelated Articles (4)\nAdditional Learning Resources for Copilot\nResources and learning paths that can help you get started with Microsoft 365 Copilot.\nApproved AI tools at SFU\nInformation about, and guidance on the use of, the approved AI tools at SFU.\nIntroduction to Prompts in Copilot\nGet familiar with the basics of constructing good prompts and learn about a few prompt engineering techniques so you get the most out of your questions to Copilot.\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot\nLearn more about Microsoft 365 Copilot (a personalized productivity AI assistant) at SFU.",

    "clean_body_text": "Email Distribution Lists\nOverview\nBelow are common questions about Simplelists: a service that provides a way to enable group discussions over email that include non-SFU members.\nDETAILS\nHOW DO I FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT SIMPLELISTS?\nSee the\nEmail Distribution Lists service page\nabout Simplelists at SFU. The vendor also has support and information at their\nhomepage https://www.simplelists.com\nSIMPLELISTS APPEARS TO BE A FEE-FOR-SERVICE TOOL. IS THERE A COST TO USE THE SERVICE?\nSFU has an account with Simplelists. Any email address can participate in a list as a member, but if you wish to host a list with a @lists.sfu.ca email address you must be an SFU Account holder and request access from the\nEmail Distribution Lists service page.\nDOES SFU HAVE AN ENTERPRISE LICENSE FOR SIMPLELISTS?\nYes. As an SFU Account holder, you can request access from the\nEmail Distribution Lists service page.\nSHOULD I USE CAMPAIGNER OR SIMPLELISTS FOR SENDING EMAILS TO EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS?\nThere are three ways to manage email lists at SFU, Campaigner or Simplelists are for any email list that contains at least one external member (an address that is not in \"sfu.ca\"). If your email is for non-marketing, internal communications to sfu.ca email addresses, use\nSFU Maillist\ninstead.\nIf your message is at all marketing related such as advertising events, services, programs, broad outreach to large groups of people with no discussion between those members, Campaigner is the best tool as it meets all the requirements for allowing people to manage their subscriptions in marketing messages. It is one-way messaging only: from you to the members.\nSimplelists' primary use case is groups of people who need to communicate as a group. For example, a researcher who is an expert in a topic at SFU that wants to host a discussion on that topic with people at other institutions in Canada or worldwide. Think of a discussion forum where all the members can interact. Functionally Simplelists will perform a similar role to something like Google Groups email forums, but provides an email address that shows the discussion is being hosted at SFU with an email address in the form:\nlistname\n@lists.sfu.ca\nHOW DO I CREATE or manage LISTS IN SIMPLELISTS?\nFirst, as an SFU Account holder you must request an account in order to host one or more lists. Request access at the\nEmail Distribution Lists service page.\nOnce you have access, see help at the vendor's website:\nhttps://www.simplelists.com/support/\nHOW DO I ADD/REMOVE EMAILS IN SIMPLELISTS?\nFirst, as an SFU Account holder you must request an account in order to host one or more lists. Request access at the\nEmail Distribution Lists service page.\nOnce you have access, see help at the vendor's website:\nhttps://www.simplelists.com/support/\nWhat are approved uses of SIMPLELISTS? Are there limitations to its use?\nSimplelists is intended to help the University support its research and academic mission where communication with non-SFU account holders requires email. List approvals will be subject to the lists being\nrelated to the activities of the University\nProperly representing the membership and ownership of the list, not appearing to represent another entity\nusing list names that use appropriate language without language that profanity, is intentionally misleading, or otherwise problematic as a public SFU service\nLists that are misrepresentative, misleading, or use offensive language may be removed or disabled by the administrators of the SimpleLists service\nRelated Services / Offerings (1)\nEmail Distribution Lists\nTools that provides the ability to send email messages to multiple email addresses using a list or a group.",
